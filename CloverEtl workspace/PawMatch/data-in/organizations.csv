We just need the time to find it..  . Most of the animals in our care have been rescued, so we ensure their new homes will be better than the last. .  . We ask every potential adoptee to complete an adoption application.  The board reviews each application and the best home for the pet will be chosen.  We arrange for a home visit; use a legal and binding adoption contract and charge an adoption fee that is applied towards the vet bill and care of the pet.  In most cases the adoption fee does not cover our out -of-pocket costs so we rely upon the help of many to place the animal in its final home.","For the most part, we reply primarily on the internet because we all work full-time jobs during the week!. . We do not have a physical building - but we try to participate in Saturday adoption events from 11am - 3pm, on a regular basis. Our new home is the new Petsmart in Fort Lauderdale, located at 1700 N.

In order to qualify for adopting a horse, you must:. . Already own a horse, preferably at least five years.. . Maintain the animal(s) on your own property where you reside.. . Be 18 years of age or older.. . A barn or lean-to, safe and proper fencing (board or wire mesh is appropriate--not barbed wire), and adequate water/feed supply (including a way to keep water from freezing in the winter) is required.. . The adoptive owner(s) must provide the name, phone number and address of their veterinarian, farrier, and person who will care for the animals when the owner is away.. . Periodic checks may be made of adopted animal(s) by a DPMU representative for the lifetime of the horse. The adoptive owner agrees to submit a DPMU Adoption Update Form on the animal(s) each year on or before the date of adoption until DPMU deems this is no longer necessary.. . All animal(s) will go to the best/most appropriate home that we feel meets the horses needs. Our fees are based on what it cost us to procure the animal and pay vet and shipping costs.. . Any animal adopted from DPMU may not be moved to a new location or leased or loaned to another person without prior approval from DPMU. DPMU also reserves the right of first refusal if for any reason the adoptive owner is unable or unwilling to maintain the animal properly.. . Dreamchaser Horse Rescue & Rehabilitation cannot guarantee any animal(s) as to its disposition or training. Animals which come into our custody are usually young and untrained. Due to their usually debilitated condition, temperament generally changes with proper care. Dreamchaser Horse Rescue & Rehabilitation will include with each adoption a complete file on the animal(s), which will explain how the animal came to be on the farm, what veterinary care it received while it was here and what the staff has personally noticed about the animal's disposition and training.. . Because certain homes that do not meet our preliminary criteria may qualify to adopt certain animals, please contact the office if you have any question about your eligibility.. .

We ask for your understanding: We are an all-volunteer organization and many of us have full-time jobs outside of our volunteer activities; therefore, it may be a few days before someone can respond to your email. We always try to reply as soon as possible.The kitties are for adoption, not for sale. Adoption fee for kittens is $125 ($200 for two) to help cover some of our food and veterinary expenses. All cats and kittens are:. .     vaccinated as appropriate for their age.     microchipped.     dewormed.     deflead.     tested for FELV (feline leukemia) / FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus).     spayed/neutered prior to adoption. . We will ask you some questions about your home and we will be glad to answer any questions you may have. Adopting a kitty is a long-term commitment; the average life span for a kitty is 15-20 years.. . Most of our cats are in foster homes with other cats. They get lonely and bored without the company of their own kind, just like people. We try to place cats that enjoy the company of other cats in a home where there is feline companionship. But we do have many cats that would be happy to be the only cat in your life!. . Regardless of how an animal comes to us, we provide food, shelter, and medical care. The animals do not live in cages but in volunteer foster homes. We usually know the personalities of the cats and kittens we rescue, so we can tell you which cat or kitten(s) might be the best match for you and/or the feline companion you already have. . . http://www.13thstcats.org/info/adoption","Adoption Events are held typically every Saturday from 12-4pm @ PetsMart Campbell. 850 W.

Animals that are listed for Sponsorship are not yet available for adoption. If you are interested in adopting an animal currently listed for Sponsorship, please wait for the animal's status to change to Available to submit an application. You are welcome to sponsor the animal, but Sponsorship does not necessarily guarantee approval to adopt..     Every application is assigned to and reviewed by an Adoption Counselor who will follow up with you..     Depending on the volume of applications we receive for a particular animal, the response time may vary from one day to a couple weeks.

There is no need to complete a new application if you decide on a different animal - just send us an email..     Not every application will be approved. However, we hope that you understand that every decision we make is with the animal's best interest in mind.","We do not have a shelter location where you can come to meet the animals.

That way, if it is approved, you would be able to come to the event and choose from what is available at that time.

If a particular horse interests them, they should put that horse's name on the application. An USERL volunteer will contact them to discuss the horse and put them in contact with the foster home. Once the potential adopter, foster home and the appropriate USERL Regional Director and/or Executive Director agree that the horse and adopter is a match, USERL will schedule a barn check.  An USERL volunteer will schedule a time to meet you at your barn. S/he will be looking for safety (i.e. no barbed wire, no junk in the pastures), a clean, healthy environment and the condition and temperament of your other horses, if any.

In addition, the USERL will also conduct interviews of the references provided by the potential adopter on the Preliminary Adoption Application. . Upon satisfactory completion of the above, USERL will schedule a working session with the potential equine to determine if this is a suitable match. . Upon the completion of the session, it will be determined whether or not the equine and potential adopter are compatible. The USERL may at that time require additional sessions.  . Facility requirement: The facility shall have at least a roof and three sides and be in good repair and free of standing water. The equine must be allowed a minimum of 4 hours of daily turn out in a suitable and safe fenced area.  Barbed wire is not accepted by the USERL. The USERL requests that the adopted equine be kept with a companion equine or other compatible large herd animal. .

If you are in a hurry to adopt a Doberman, LOMDR is not an organization you will have a successful experience with. It is in everyone?  best interest to be thorough and thoughtful throughout every step of our application process. . . STEP 1 Complete the application and return to LOMDR. You may choose to submit your application by way of regular mail, email, or fax. Mailing address, e-mail and fax are listed on the top portion of the application. Please note that during the application process you may be working with several different volunteers. . . STEP2 Once your application is received, a volunteer will contact you. Please be patient, as all members are volunteers, it may take up to a week to be contacted. The volunteer will discuss what you are looking for or about the specific dog you are inquiring about to determine a good fit. . . STEP 3 Veterinarian checks and reference checks will be conducted. It is absolutely mandatory that your past and current animals are up to date on vaccinations and are also spayed/neutered. Current pets must also be maintained on heartworm preventative. LOMDR strives to help control the pet population and will not adopt to homes with animals not spayed/neutered unless there is a medical reason or you are showing your dog in the ring. . . STEP 4 While we are in the process of completing your application, a volunteer will contact you to schedule an interview and home visit. The purpose of this visit is to ensure a safe environment for the dog and to verify the information you have listed on your application. The interview helps ensure the adopting family understands the responsibilities of owning and caring for a Doberman. LOMDR may also take this time to allow you to have a visit with the dog (if available) to see how the family interacts. The adoption process WILL NOT be completed until an interview and home visit is complete. . . STEP 5 We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if, in our judgment, the home situation is not compatible with the needs of a Doberman or if the breed is not suitable for the applicant. To complete a valid adoption, an adoption contract must be signed and an adoption donation collected. The adoption donation serves to reimburse Lean On Me Doberman Rescue for the medical costs invested in your new pet. All adoption donations should be made payable to Lean On Me Doberman Rescue. . .

The Adoption Center is a busy place, so please be patient and allow yourself enough time for our process.  THANK YOU!. . What we will need to know when you adopt a new companion:. . If you own your home, please bring some item of verification (tax bill, water bill, or mortgage statement.)  Please also be sure to check your homeowner?  insurance policy.  Some policies restrict coverage for certain dog breeds.. . If you DO NOT own your place of residence, please be sure the property owner will consent to have a pet on his/her property.  We will verify with landlords over the phone before sending a new companion home, so please have the appropriate name and phone number available.. . Other pets already living with you will need to be up-to-date on vaccination.  This is to decrease the risk of spreading infectious disease from one animal to another.. . It is important to understand that your new companion will be a member of your family.  This can mean a . 10-15 year commitment from you!  Please bring along family members so we can make sure it will be a good match before you make a commitment.  Also, if adopting a second dog, please bring your current dog with you---we can let them spend some time together and give you some suggestions on surviving the adjustment period.. . Please be sure you have considered the financial obligation involved in caring for a companion animal.  This includes routine veterinary and emergency care, in addition to food, supplies and training.  The adoption counselors can give you an idea of basic costs involved for each type of animal.. . Many animals adopted from shelters can require an immediate visit to the veterinarian.  Because of the volume of un-vaccinated animals entering a shelter?  care, the risk of transmissible contagious diseases can be quite high.  Kennel cough in dogs, and upper respiratory infections in cats are the two most common diseases that your newly adopted companion may experience.  You must ask yourself if you have the financial means to care for your new friend, beyond the initial adoption costs.. . BEFORE YOU COMMIT!!!!!  Please be honest with yourself about the actual time you have to train, groom, and exercise the companion animal you have chosen.  Some things to consider: Do you work long or erratic hours?  Do you like outdoor activity?  Who will care for your pet while you travel?  Will your pet be the appropriate size when he or she is full grown?  When adopting into a home with children:  Are you adopting to teach your child responsibility, or are your adopting because you have a responsible child?  Are your children comfortable around the animal you? ve chosen?  Will YOU still remain committed to this animal when the children lose interest?  Take the time now to consider these things and find the best match for your lifestyle!. . We thank your for offering your home to a ?pre-loved? companion.  We hope he or she will be a wonderful addition to your family and your home!. ","Monday-Friday 12:00-4:30. Saturday 12:00-4:00. Closed Sundays and holidays",Adoptions,No,"Yes"

You can then spend time with the pet and learn much more about bringing the pet into your home. Feel free to ask for recommendations. Don? t forget, we work with our pets every day and may know the perfect one for you.. . Weekends are very busy. Please be patient, we want to make sure we find the perfect pet for you.. .

So, you? re ready to adopt a boxer from Legacy Boxer Rescue? Before we can begin the adoption process, you must fill out an Adoption Application in it?  entirety. The following requirements must be met before an adoption can take place:. .     * Applications will only be accepted within the Dallas/Ft Worth Metroplex. Please email us if you are outside of this area so that we can assess your situation individually.. .     * Any other pets that you have must be fully vetted, this includes that they be spayed/neutered and up to date on ALL vaccinations. No exceptions will be made to this rule, so please do not apply if your pets are not spayed/neutered and current on vaccinations. This also includes cats! All dogs and cats (since it was only recently discovered that cats are susceptible to heartworms some exceptions may be made for indoor cats in this regard) must also be tested for heartworms and on some form of heartworm prevention. If you purchase heartworm prevention and/or flea/tick products through an online pharmacy like www.petcarerx.com we will need copies of your purchase history which can be obtained from the online pharmacy.. .     * All applicants must be 21 years of age and living on your own. If you are under 21 and living at home with your parents, please have them fill out the adoption application for you.. .     * If you have children under the age of ten, certain criteria will need to be met before a boxer is placed in your home. LBR will be happy to discuss this with each family as the need arises.. .     * All domesticated animals (with the exception of feral cats) must be kept as indoor residents of your home. We do not place our boxers in homes with or as outdoor companion animals.. .     * We will not place two female dogs in the same home. With the dominance issues commonly seen in females, we feel we can increase the odds for a successful adoption by not placing females in the same home together.. . . ONCE WE'VE RECEIVED YOUR APPLICATION.... Once we have received your completed application, here is a list of what you can expect. We realize that this seems like a lot, and it may even seem invasive to some, but we want you to adopt a boxer if you meet the criteria described herein, so please bear with us. Most, if not all, of our volunteers work full time and have families of their own to care for, and we do our best to ensure that all applications are processed in a timely fashion but we do ask that you please have patience.. .     * An LBR volunteer will check the personal and veterinary references listed on your application. Since most vets require their clients permission to release any records, please contact your vet so that we are able to complete the vet check for your application. Once the personal and veterinary references are checked, and deemed acceptable, an LBR volunteer will contact you to schedule a home visit. We conduct the home visit to ensure that our boxers have a safe and loving environment to call home.. .     * On the application, you are asked to list any boxers that you have seen on LBR?  website that you may be interested in adopting. But please be aware that often times we have more than one applicant interested in the same boxer. In that case, the home best suited for the boxer will be chosen for placement. LBR does not do adoptions on a ?first come, first served? basis, and in many cases we may make a recommendation depending on your circumstances.. .     * After finding a boxer that you and LBR are in agreement would be a good match for you, we ask that you make arrangements to meet the boxer. Generally, this involves attending one of our Meet Our Boxer events, or we may ask the foster family to contact you directly. When you visit a boxer, we ask that all family members be present, as well as any current pets if possible.. .     * In some cases, we may feel that a particular boxer is not a good match for you and your family, please do not be offended by this. LBR does not take the placement of a boxer lightly, and we strive to do our best to ensure that each placement is forever, as many of these wonderful boxers have led very unstable lives before coming into rescue and we only want what is best for them. We will be happy to disclose our reasons for the decisions that we make in this regard.. . . WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MY APPLICATION IS APPROVED?. Once your application has been approved and you have found the boxer of your dreams, there are only a few items remaining in this process.. .     * Our adoption donation?  range from $125.00 to $300.00 depending on the dog being adopted. This determination is based on many factors, to include, but not limited to the dog?  age and any past adoption history with LBR. Our boxers are examined for any health issues, spayed/neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, and are protected from heartworms, fleas and ticks while in foster care. LBR uses Revolution, an all-inclusive topical agent for heartworm, flea and tick prevention, or Heartgard HW Prevention and Frontline Flea/Tick Prevention. While in foster care, LBR volunteers work with the boxers on basic obedience commands, but we cannot guarantee that every dog will learn basic obedience commands while in foster care. LBR always recommends that the new owners find a training center that utilizes only positive training techniques for their new family member to help him or her be the best possible companion animal for you and your family.. .     * Upon adoption LBR will have you sign a legally binding adoption agreement. If there ever comes a time when you wish to give up your boxer he/she MUST be returned to LBR as stated in the adoption agreement. Adopter also agrees that the provided Legacy Boxer Rescue tag will remain on the boxer at all times, and LBR must be notified if the boxer is ever lost or stolen, we have many resources in the area that could help in locating your boxer should such an event ever take place.. .     * Be prepared for the arrival of your new boxer, please click here for a list of items that LBR recommends that you have on hand when he/she comes home.. .

Once you have completed an application, we will contact you to talk about a specific dog  about whom you? ve expressed interest. . . After you? ve been approved, we arrange for you to meet the dog, either at an adoption event or in a one-on-one introduction. Often, you can go home with your new companion the same day, though for some dogs? mall puppies and special-needs animals? we will schedule a home visit before finalizing the adoption. Or, you may FOSTER an animal with the intent to adopt to ensure a good fit for both of you.. We ask for donations to help us cover spay/neutering, shots, medical treatment, food, and supplies.. .  . . What if the adoption doesn't work out?.      We have a lifetime return policy on our dogs, however, we have the application process to help prevent such an issue, so it's very important that you are honest when answering the questions.  Not all dogs are compatible in all situations, so it's imperative that you are forthright in the application process so we can help find the right match.  However, be sure you are ready to make a full commitment to adopting a dog, whether a puppy or an adult.  A dog is not a novelty or a toy, so the prospect of adopting should be well-thought-out & the commitment should be taken seriously.. .  . .  . ADOPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS. .     * We often have many applications for a certain animal.  Please be advised that we will not be letting each person who submits an application know how many others are interested, just keep in mind that there may be others interested so it is best to schedule your meet and greet as soon as possible.  Sometimes people who submit applications do not follow through or are not approved so we want all applications to be reviewed in order to make sure that we put all our effort into choosing the best home for our rescues.  This is why we do not stop accepting applications just because one person is interested in the dog.. . .     * Just because your adoption application is approved, does not mean you have been approved to adopt the dog.  The purpose of the meet and greet which is scheduled once the application is approved is a chance for YOU to see if the dog would make a good fit and for US to decide if we feel the dog would make a good fit for your family.  Any representative at Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has the right to decide to what family we adopt our dogs into.  It is not first come first serve, it is best family best serve.. . .     * Additionally, if you are approved for adoption after the meet and greet, we can offer many different ways for you to take the pet including placing an adoption hold, fostering to adopt, or adopt via spay/neuter contract (meaning you are agreeing to take the dog unaltered into your home under the condition that one of our representatives will be taking the dog to get fixed between the prescribed time period).. . .     * Adoption holds are not offered until we meet you in person.. . .     * So please when you are filling out an application don't rush to the store to buy dog supplies or tell your children about your new adopted dog because there is always a possibility that someone else may adopt before you or that you may not be considered the best fit for the particular dog after the meet and greet and/or homecheck.. . .     * All dogs are microchipped to us and you will be added as the alternative contact.  Our dogs are rescued by us for life.. . .     * Also, any foster family working with Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has priority in whatever dog they are fostering; that is if I let them know that someone is interested and approved to meet the dog, if the foster wishes to adopt they will be our first choice.. . .     * These terms and conditions are set forth to not only protect our rescue and our dogs in ensuring that they go to the best home possible but also to protect your emotions and well-being.  We know that the possibility of adopting a dog is very exciting but it is important to follow the process and understand that the dog is not considered yours for adoption until an adoption contract has been signed.

The very best way to pick a pet is to come to the Adoption Center to meet available pets. If you find a pet you wish to adopt, our adoption coordinators will talk with you to help make this adoption a perfect match for you and the pet.. .   Another benefit for visiting in person is that animals and adopters frequently have a special relationship that starts the very first time they meet.  You may find the love of your life being very different than what you envisioned.  The pet you will be most pleased with will be the one with the temperament that fits your personality and homelife.  That frequently has absolutely nothing to do with the looks or breed of the animal.. .  When you adopt an AWL pet, you will have an animal that has been checked by our veterinarians, spayed or neutered, given basic shots (including Rabies),  a folder with the medical history and various useful information, and someone to answer any questions you might have. . .    We will ask you to promise that, if for any reason it does not work out, that you will bring the animal back to us.

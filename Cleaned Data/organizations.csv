We just need the time to find it..  . Most of the animals in our care have been rescued, so we ensure their new homes will be better than the last. .  . We ask every potential adoptee to complete an adoption application.  The board reviews each application and the best home for the pet will be chosen.  We arrange for a home visit; use a legal and binding adoption contract and charge an adoption fee that is applied towards the vet bill and care of the pet.  In most cases the adoption fee does not cover our out -of-pocket costs so we rely upon the help of many to place the animal in its final home.	For the most part, we reply primarily on the internet because we all work full-time jobs during the week!. . We do not have a physical building - but we try to participate in Saturday adoption events from 11am - 3pm, on a regular basis. Our new home is the new Petsmart in Fort Lauderdale, located at 1700 N. Federal Highway, a little south of Whole Foods, and directly across from Zona Fresca.. .  It is always best to check the Upcoming Events page of our website www.gratefulpaws.org/upcomingevents.html or give us a call to find out where we are going to be. Week nights 954-462-8840 eves after 8pm or on the week-ends: 954-579-3753.. . Our email is monitored day and night, and is the best way to contact us.. Email: info@gratefulpaws.org.

In order to qualify for adopting a horse, you must:. . Already own a horse, preferably at least five years.. . Maintain the animal(s) on your own property where you reside.. . Be 18 years of age or older.. . A barn or lean-to, safe and proper fencing (board or wire mesh is appropriate--not barbed wire), and adequate water/feed supply (including a way to keep water from freezing in the winter) is required.. . The adoptive owner(s) must provide the name, phone number and address of their veterinarian, farrier, and person who will care for the animals when the owner is away.. . Periodic checks may be made of adopted animal(s) by a DPMU representative for the lifetime of the horse. The adoptive owner agrees to submit a DPMU Adoption Update Form on the animal(s) each year on or before the date of adoption until DPMU deems this is no longer necessary.. . All animal(s) will go to the best/most appropriate home that we feel meets the horses needs. Our fees are based on what it cost us to procure the animal and pay vet and shipping costs.. . Any animal adopted from DPMU may not be moved to a new location or leased or loaned to another person without prior approval from DPMU. DPMU also reserves the right of first refusal if for any reason the adoptive owner is unable or unwilling to maintain the animal properly.. . Dreamchaser Horse Rescue & Rehabilitation cannot guarantee any animal(s) as to its disposition or training. Animals which come into our custody are usually young and untrained. Due to their usually debilitated condition, temperament generally changes with proper care. Dreamchaser Horse Rescue & Rehabilitation will include with each adoption a complete file on the animal(s), which will explain how the animal came to be on the farm, what veterinary care it received while it was here and what the staff has personally noticed about the animal's disposition and training.. . Because certain homes that do not meet our preliminary criteria may qualify to adopt certain animals, please contact the office if you have any question about your eligibility.. . See our website for application.	Daily at the ranch	adoptions, rescue, and rehabilitation	No	Yes

Once you submit an application, a volunteer will contact you. All of our kitties are in foster homes; some can be seen at the foster homes, or at an upcoming Adoption Fair. We ask for your understanding: We are an all-volunteer organization and many of us have full-time jobs outside of our volunteer activities; therefore, it may be a few days before someone can respond to your email. We always try to reply as soon as possible.The kitties are for adoption, not for sale. Adoption fee for kittens is $125 ($200 for two) to help cover some of our food and veterinary expenses. All cats and kittens are:. .     vaccinated as appropriate for their age.     microchipped.     dewormed.     deflead.     tested for FELV (feline leukemia) / FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus).     spayed/neutered prior to adoption. . We will ask you some questions about your home and we will be glad to answer any questions you may have. Adopting a kitty is a long-term commitment; the average life span for a kitty is 15-20 years.. . Most of our cats are in foster homes with other cats. They get lonely and bored without the company of their own kind, just like people. We try to place cats that enjoy the company of other cats in a home where there is feline companionship. But we do have many cats that would be happy to be the only cat in your life!. . Regardless of how an animal comes to us, we provide food, shelter, and medical care. The animals do not live in cages but in volunteer foster homes. We usually know the personalities of the cats and kittens we rescue, so we can tell you which cat or kitten(s) might be the best match for you and/or the feline companion you already have. . . http://www.13thstcats.org/info/adoption	Adoption Events are held typically every Saturday from 12-4pm @ PetsMart Campbell. 850 W.

The first step in the Adoption Process is to register on our website..     Once you have registered, the system will generate and email you a password..     Use your User Name and Password log in to the website..     Once logged in, you can complete the Adoption Application for the animal in which you are interested..     Animals that are listed for Sponsorship are not yet available for adoption. If you are interested in adopting an animal currently listed for Sponsorship, please wait for the animal's status to change to Available to submit an application. You are welcome to sponsor the animal, but Sponsorship does not necessarily guarantee approval to adopt..     Every application is assigned to and reviewed by an Adoption Counselor who will follow up with you..     Depending on the volume of applications we receive for a particular animal, the response time may vary from one day to a couple weeks. Please understand that our Adoption Counselors are all volunteers who perform this service in addition to their regular jobs. We appreciate your patience..     There is no need to complete a new application if you decide on a different animal - just send us an email..     Not every application will be approved. However, we hope that you understand that every decision we make is with the animal's best interest in mind.	We do not have a shelter location where you can come to meet the animals.  We are 100% volunteer and our animals are kept in private foster homes until they are ready for adoption.. . We have weekly events as listed on our website under the Events Link, where you can come to see the pups, but if one of your choices is pre-approved for an online application it would not be available for adoption.. . It is best to pick one of your favorites, and get an application in so it can be reviewed.  That way, if it is approved, you would be able to come to the event and choose from what is available at that time.  Keep in mind though, an approval for one particular dog or puppy does not guarantee approval for another, we have to make sure the pup is going to the best possible forever home.	Adoptions	No	Yes

Potential adopters first need to fill out an adoption application. If a particular horse interests them, they should put that horse's name on the application. An USERL volunteer will contact them to discuss the horse and put them in contact with the foster home. Once the potential adopter, foster home and the appropriate USERL Regional Director and/or Executive Director agree that the horse and adopter is a match, USERL will schedule a barn check.  An USERL volunteer will schedule a time to meet you at your barn. S/he will be looking for safety (i.e. no barbed wire, no junk in the pastures), a clean, healthy environment and the condition and temperament of your other horses, if any.  Depending on how quickly you can get out to meet the equine and how quickly we can get a volunteer to do your barn check, typically the process takes one week to one month.. Complete and return the USERL Preliminary Adoption Application.  We will then contact you directly if we have additional questions. . If the personal interview is satisfactory and if the USERL has a potentially suitable equine at the time, the USERL will schedule an appointment to check the potential adopter's facilities. In addition, the USERL will also conduct interviews of the references provided by the potential adopter on the Preliminary Adoption Application. . Upon satisfactory completion of the above, USERL will schedule a working session with the potential equine to determine if this is a suitable match. . Upon the completion of the session, it will be determined whether or not the equine and potential adopter are compatible. The USERL may at that time require additional sessions.  . Facility requirement: The facility shall have at least a roof and three sides and be in good repair and free of standing water. The equine must be allowed a minimum of 4 hours of daily turn out in a suitable and safe fenced area.  Barbed wire is not accepted by the USERL. The USERL requests that the adopted equine be kept with a companion equine or other compatible large herd animal. . When all requirements and preliminary adoption procedures have been satisfied, the USERL will require the following at the time of final adoption:. Completion of a permanent Adoption Contract detailing the care, which is required for the individual equines being adopted.    . Payment in full of an adoption fee (non-refundable after 30 days), which is based upon each individual equine, and set by the USERL at its sole discretion. . The USERL reserves the right to conduct unscheduled follow-up on the Adopted Animal and the facility at the USERL's discretion. If either are found to be in unsatisfactory condition, attempts will be made to help the adopters remedy the situation.  If these attempts are unsuccessful, the USERL retains the right to repossess the adopted equine at any time.  The USERL may require the adopter to submit to them receipt of proof of required veterinary and farrier care and/or an annual health statement from the adopter's veterinarian and farrier.	http://www.userl.org/horsepages/available.html	Rescue/Rehabilitate/Foster/Adoption	No	Yes

Our satisfaction comes from knowing we have helped an orphaned Doberman find its forever home. If you are in a hurry to adopt a Doberman, LOMDR is not an organization you will have a successful experience with. It is in everyone?  best interest to be thorough and thoughtful throughout every step of our application process. . . STEP 1 Complete the application and return to LOMDR. You may choose to submit your application by way of regular mail, email, or fax. Mailing address, e-mail and fax are listed on the top portion of the application. Please note that during the application process you may be working with several different volunteers. . . STEP2 Once your application is received, a volunteer will contact you. Please be patient, as all members are volunteers, it may take up to a week to be contacted. The volunteer will discuss what you are looking for or about the specific dog you are inquiring about to determine a good fit. . . STEP 3 Veterinarian checks and reference checks will be conducted. It is absolutely mandatory that your past and current animals are up to date on vaccinations and are also spayed/neutered. Current pets must also be maintained on heartworm preventative. LOMDR strives to help control the pet population and will not adopt to homes with animals not spayed/neutered unless there is a medical reason or you are showing your dog in the ring. . . STEP 4 While we are in the process of completing your application, a volunteer will contact you to schedule an interview and home visit. The purpose of this visit is to ensure a safe environment for the dog and to verify the information you have listed on your application. The interview helps ensure the adopting family understands the responsibilities of owning and caring for a Doberman. LOMDR may also take this time to allow you to have a visit with the dog (if available) to see how the family interacts. The adoption process WILL NOT be completed until an interview and home visit is complete. . . STEP 5 We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if, in our judgment, the home situation is not compatible with the needs of a Doberman or if the breed is not suitable for the applicant. To complete a valid adoption, an adoption contract must be signed and an adoption donation collected. The adoption donation serves to reimburse Lean On Me Doberman Rescue for the medical costs invested in your new pet. All adoption donations should be made payable to Lean On Me Doberman Rescue. . . Because LOMDR is a non-for-profit group, this fee simply is deposited into a pool of funds to help the next Doberman Pinscher in need of our assistance. . .

This will help the adoption counselors facilitate the matchmaking process.  Most adoptions take at least 45 minutes to one hour to complete.  The Adoption Center is a busy place, so please be patient and allow yourself enough time for our process.  THANK YOU!. . What we will need to know when you adopt a new companion:. . If you own your home, please bring some item of verification (tax bill, water bill, or mortgage statement.)  Please also be sure to check your homeowner?  insurance policy.  Some policies restrict coverage for certain dog breeds.. . If you DO NOT own your place of residence, please be sure the property owner will consent to have a pet on his/her property.  We will verify with landlords over the phone before sending a new companion home, so please have the appropriate name and phone number available.. . Other pets already living with you will need to be up-to-date on vaccination.  This is to decrease the risk of spreading infectious disease from one animal to another.. . It is important to understand that your new companion will be a member of your family.  This can mean a . 10-15 year commitment from you!  Please bring along family members so we can make sure it will be a good match before you make a commitment.  Also, if adopting a second dog, please bring your current dog with you---we can let them spend some time together and give you some suggestions on surviving the adjustment period.. . Please be sure you have considered the financial obligation involved in caring for a companion animal.  This includes routine veterinary and emergency care, in addition to food, supplies and training.  The adoption counselors can give you an idea of basic costs involved for each type of animal.. . Many animals adopted from shelters can require an immediate visit to the veterinarian.  Because of the volume of un-vaccinated animals entering a shelter?  care, the risk of transmissible contagious diseases can be quite high.  Kennel cough in dogs, and upper respiratory infections in cats are the two most common diseases that your newly adopted companion may experience.  You must ask yourself if you have the financial means to care for your new friend, beyond the initial adoption costs.. . BEFORE YOU COMMIT!!!!!  Please be honest with yourself about the actual time you have to train, groom, and exercise the companion animal you have chosen.  Some things to consider: Do you work long or erratic hours?  Do you like outdoor activity?  Who will care for your pet while you travel?  Will your pet be the appropriate size when he or she is full grown?  When adopting into a home with children:  Are you adopting to teach your child responsibility, or are your adopting because you have a responsible child?  Are your children comfortable around the animal you? ve chosen?  Will YOU still remain committed to this animal when the children lose interest?  Take the time now to consider these things and find the best match for your lifestyle!. . We thank your for offering your home to a ?pre-loved? companion.  We hope he or she will be a wonderful addition to your family and your home!. 	Monday-Friday 12:00-4:30. Saturday 12:00-4:00. Closed Sundays and holidays	Adoptions	No	Yes

Once you see a pet you might be interested in adopting, remember that pet's name and come to the main lobby in the Grace Pavilion. We can help you find the pet that best fits your lifestyle.. . Once you meet with an Adoption Coordinator, they will bring the pet to meet you and to see if it's a match. You can then spend time with the pet and learn much more about bringing the pet into your home. Feel free to ask for recommendations. Don? t forget, we work with our pets every day and may know the perfect one for you.. . Weekends are very busy. Please be patient, we want to make sure we find the perfect pet for you.. .

So, you? re ready to adopt a boxer from Legacy Boxer Rescue? Before we can begin the adoption process, you must fill out an Adoption Application in it?  entirety. The following requirements must be met before an adoption can take place:. .     * Applications will only be accepted within the Dallas/Ft Worth Metroplex. Please email us if you are outside of this area so that we can assess your situation individually.. .     * Any other pets that you have must be fully vetted, this includes that they be spayed/neutered and up to date on ALL vaccinations. No exceptions will be made to this rule, so please do not apply if your pets are not spayed/neutered and current on vaccinations. This also includes cats! All dogs and cats (since it was only recently discovered that cats are susceptible to heartworms some exceptions may be made for indoor cats in this regard) must also be tested for heartworms and on some form of heartworm prevention. If you purchase heartworm prevention and/or flea/tick products through an online pharmacy like www.petcarerx.com we will need copies of your purchase history which can be obtained from the online pharmacy.. .     * All applicants must be 21 years of age and living on your own. If you are under 21 and living at home with your parents, please have them fill out the adoption application for you.. .     * If you have children under the age of ten, certain criteria will need to be met before a boxer is placed in your home. LBR will be happy to discuss this with each family as the need arises.. .     * All domesticated animals (with the exception of feral cats) must be kept as indoor residents of your home. We do not place our boxers in homes with or as outdoor companion animals.. .     * We will not place two female dogs in the same home. With the dominance issues commonly seen in females, we feel we can increase the odds for a successful adoption by not placing females in the same home together.. . . ONCE WE'VE RECEIVED YOUR APPLICATION.... Once we have received your completed application, here is a list of what you can expect. We realize that this seems like a lot, and it may even seem invasive to some, but we want you to adopt a boxer if you meet the criteria described herein, so please bear with us. Most, if not all, of our volunteers work full time and have families of their own to care for, and we do our best to ensure that all applications are processed in a timely fashion but we do ask that you please have patience.. .     * An LBR volunteer will check the personal and veterinary references listed on your application. Since most vets require their clients permission to release any records, please contact your vet so that we are able to complete the vet check for your application. Once the personal and veterinary references are checked, and deemed acceptable, an LBR volunteer will contact you to schedule a home visit. We conduct the home visit to ensure that our boxers have a safe and loving environment to call home.. .     * On the application, you are asked to list any boxers that you have seen on LBR?  website that you may be interested in adopting. But please be aware that often times we have more than one applicant interested in the same boxer. In that case, the home best suited for the boxer will be chosen for placement. LBR does not do adoptions on a ?first come, first served? basis, and in many cases we may make a recommendation depending on your circumstances.. .     * After finding a boxer that you and LBR are in agreement would be a good match for you, we ask that you make arrangements to meet the boxer. Generally, this involves attending one of our Meet Our Boxer events, or we may ask the foster family to contact you directly. When you visit a boxer, we ask that all family members be present, as well as any current pets if possible.. .     * In some cases, we may feel that a particular boxer is not a good match for you and your family, please do not be offended by this. LBR does not take the placement of a boxer lightly, and we strive to do our best to ensure that each placement is forever, as many of these wonderful boxers have led very unstable lives before coming into rescue and we only want what is best for them. We will be happy to disclose our reasons for the decisions that we make in this regard.. . . WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MY APPLICATION IS APPROVED?. Once your application has been approved and you have found the boxer of your dreams, there are only a few items remaining in this process.. .     * Our adoption donation?  range from $125.00 to $300.00 depending on the dog being adopted. This determination is based on many factors, to include, but not limited to the dog?  age and any past adoption history with LBR. Our boxers are examined for any health issues, spayed/neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, and are protected from heartworms, fleas and ticks while in foster care. LBR uses Revolution, an all-inclusive topical agent for heartworm, flea and tick prevention, or Heartgard HW Prevention and Frontline Flea/Tick Prevention. While in foster care, LBR volunteers work with the boxers on basic obedience commands, but we cannot guarantee that every dog will learn basic obedience commands while in foster care. LBR always recommends that the new owners find a training center that utilizes only positive training techniques for their new family member to help him or her be the best possible companion animal for you and your family.. .     * Upon adoption LBR will have you sign a legally binding adoption agreement. If there ever comes a time when you wish to give up your boxer he/she MUST be returned to LBR as stated in the adoption agreement. Adopter also agrees that the provided Legacy Boxer Rescue tag will remain on the boxer at all times, and LBR must be notified if the boxer is ever lost or stolen, we have many resources in the area that could help in locating your boxer should such an event ever take place.. .     * Be prepared for the arrival of your new boxer, please click here for a list of items that LBR recommends that you have on hand when he/she comes home.. . 	http://savetheboxers.com/calendar.php	Adoptions	No	Yes

Please make sure you fill in the application completely. We are unable to process incomplete applications.. . . . After you submit your application please allow 2-3 days for a volunteer to review your application. During this time your vet reference will be checked and a volunteer with determine if it is the best match for you and the animal. Applications are not approved on a first come, first serve basis. We match up the best home for the animal, so even if the pet has other applications, this does not meet he/she will be adopted to that home. . . . . Upon approval of your application a volunteer with contact you to set up a time for you to meet the animal or animals your interested in, if you are a local adopter. Pets are shown on an appointment basis. Our animals are kept in a foster type situation and not in a shelter. Since these are private homes, this makes it easier on everyone. . . . .

Each dog or puppy in our care has an adoption fee. This can range between $50 and $200, but varies from pet to pet.

So you are out of state and have found a puppy or dog you know you would love to bring home. We use Delta Pets First to fly our new puppies home. Sometimes when no Delta Flights are available, we fly American. We do all the flight scheduling and make all arrangements. We ask that you give us the times/days you can generally pick up on and a list of local airport. Weekends are hard to book, but can be possible. We do not drug our puppies for the trip and have never had a problem with one of them not arriving safely. (although sometimes they do arrive a little messy) We recommend bringing a towel with you when you pick them up. . . . . Travel Expenses. . . . We charge 50.00 for taking your new pet to the airport, and for the time we spend buying the crate, bedding, food and water dish, and preparing your pet for travel. We also have to take your dog or cat to the veterinarian for an additional vet check, to get a health certificate, which is required by all airlines. Each of us are volunteers and we charge this additional fee to help recoup some of our expenses for gas and travel time (the airport is about one hour each way) and we generally spend an hour on each puppy/dog going out there. . . . . Crate for Shipping. . . . Your new puppy/dog will need an airline safe crate for travel. The cost of the crate depends on what size he/she requires. . . Small Crate - $45 . . Medium Crate - $65 . . Large Crate - $85 . . We line the bottom of the crate with blankets or towels for comfort and in case there is an accident and we provide a safe toy for the trip to make it easier (unless two puppies are flying together). This crate is yours to keep. . . . Health Certificate. . . . Your new friend will require a Health Certificate for travel. He/she will be taken to our Vet and given an exam. He generally checks the dog/puppy over and looks at eyes, ears, and hips. He listens to their heart and lungs. This is just part of the exam. The cost for this is $50. You will receive the health certificate with your new puppy/dog and it will have the vet's info who completed the exam.. . . . Shipping Costs. . . . You are responsible for the cost of shipping. You pay for this when you pick them up at the airport (Usually around $175 depending for most puppies/small dogs). However, if your new baby must fly American, the cost of the flight must be paid up front. . . . . . Payment Information. . . . The adoption fee, health certificate, crate costs and travel expenses are due before the puppy is sent home. We accept Paypal or you can send a money order via USPS, UPS or Fed Ex.

We are also always looking for volunteers to foster and transport. So please contact us for more information about our volunteer opportunities! . . 	Our adoption procedure is as follows:. * Email the foster person and ask for an application.. * Submit the application to the foster person. * Application will be reviewed, personal and vet references will be checked. * A phone call to the potential adopting home may be made and/or emails sent with further questions.. * Home visit scheduled and completed. . ***Rescue Alliance DOES NOT ship.

If you are interested in this fur baby, email the foster coordinator at crestedmommy@yahoo.com for an application.. Rescue Alliance is a group of foster homes across the country with no specific shelter. We do not have a specific shelter for folks to visit.. 	Our rescues are sheltered in private foster homes and treated as part of the family. There they receive love, good nutrition, veterinary care, socialization, and lots of attention. Many come from puppy mills, kill shelters, deplorable conditions, and abusive situations with a lot of emotional baggage. Their emotional issues are addressed and many of our rescues undergo rehabilitation while living in the foster home. Some have never been housebroken, and that is another goal of foster care. Some have special needs that require ongoing medical treatment. Some are older, hearing or sight impaired. It is our quest to help these animals through education, fostering, rehabilitation, and placement of those animals into loving, permanent homes. . . In an effort to help to control the unwanted animal population, we strongly support spaying and neutering. . . 	adoptions	No	Yes

Once you have completed an application, we will contact you to talk about a specific dog  about whom you? ve expressed interest. . . After you? ve been approved, we arrange for you to meet the dog, either at an adoption event or in a one-on-one introduction. Often, you can go home with your new companion the same day, though for some dogs? mall puppies and special-needs animals? we will schedule a home visit before finalizing the adoption. Or, you may FOSTER an animal with the intent to adopt to ensure a good fit for both of you.. We ask for donations to help us cover spay/neutering, shots, medical treatment, food, and supplies.. .  . . What if the adoption doesn't work out?.      We have a lifetime return policy on our dogs, however, we have the application process to help prevent such an issue, so it's very important that you are honest when answering the questions.  Not all dogs are compatible in all situations, so it's imperative that you are forthright in the application process so we can help find the right match.  However, be sure you are ready to make a full commitment to adopting a dog, whether a puppy or an adult.  A dog is not a novelty or a toy, so the prospect of adopting should be well-thought-out & the commitment should be taken seriously.. .  . .  . ADOPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS. .     * We often have many applications for a certain animal.  Please be advised that we will not be letting each person who submits an application know how many others are interested, just keep in mind that there may be others interested so it is best to schedule your meet and greet as soon as possible.  Sometimes people who submit applications do not follow through or are not approved so we want all applications to be reviewed in order to make sure that we put all our effort into choosing the best home for our rescues.  This is why we do not stop accepting applications just because one person is interested in the dog.. . .     * Just because your adoption application is approved, does not mean you have been approved to adopt the dog.  The purpose of the meet and greet which is scheduled once the application is approved is a chance for YOU to see if the dog would make a good fit and for US to decide if we feel the dog would make a good fit for your family.  Any representative at Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has the right to decide to what family we adopt our dogs into.  It is not first come first serve, it is best family best serve.. . .     * Additionally, if you are approved for adoption after the meet and greet, we can offer many different ways for you to take the pet including placing an adoption hold, fostering to adopt, or adopt via spay/neuter contract (meaning you are agreeing to take the dog unaltered into your home under the condition that one of our representatives will be taking the dog to get fixed between the prescribed time period).. . .     * Adoption holds are not offered until we meet you in person.. . .     * So please when you are filling out an application don't rush to the store to buy dog supplies or tell your children about your new adopted dog because there is always a possibility that someone else may adopt before you or that you may not be considered the best fit for the particular dog after the meet and greet and/or homecheck.. . .     * All dogs are microchipped to us and you will be added as the alternative contact.  Our dogs are rescued by us for life.. . .     * Also, any foster family working with Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has priority in whatever dog they are fostering; that is if I let them know that someone is interested and approved to meet the dog, if the foster wishes to adopt they will be our first choice.. . .     * These terms and conditions are set forth to not only protect our rescue and our dogs in ensuring that they go to the best home possible but also to protect your emotions and well-being.  We know that the possibility of adopting a dog is very exciting but it is important to follow the process and understand that the dog is not considered yours for adoption until an adoption contract has been signed.

The very best way to pick a pet is to come to the Adoption Center to meet available pets. If you find a pet you wish to adopt, our adoption coordinators will talk with you to help make this adoption a perfect match for you and the pet.. .   Another benefit for visiting in person is that animals and adopters frequently have a special relationship that starts the very first time they meet.  You may find the love of your life being very different than what you envisioned.  The pet you will be most pleased with will be the one with the temperament that fits your personality and homelife.  That frequently has absolutely nothing to do with the looks or breed of the animal.. .  When you adopt an AWL pet, you will have an animal that has been checked by our veterinarians, spayed or neutered, given basic shots (including Rabies),  a folder with the medical history and various useful information, and someone to answer any questions you might have. . .    We will ask you to promise that, if for any reason it does not work out, that you will bring the animal back to us.  We have made a financial commitment to that pet because we felt it would give someone a great deal of pleasure, therefore we made a substantial monetary and emotional commitment to the animal.  The last thing we want to hear about our pet is that it has been turned over to another shelter where it could be euthanized.. 	Adoption Center Hours. Monday - Saturday: 10:00 to 3:00.

Carmichael	CA	95608	United States			norcal@russellrescueca.com	http://www.russellrescueca.com		Rescue	Dogs	Northern California	Terriers in Rescue are in great need of proper JR homes and while they may need a little special handling, adopting a terrier in need can be much more rewarding than starting with a new puppy. However, please review the following important points regarding the adoption of a Jack Russell Terrier.. .    1. Review the Bad Dog Talk which represents the worst case scenario of owning a JRT.    2. Every applicant must first fill out an adoption form (either using the online or printed form)..    3. All rescue dogs must have containment (fence, kennel)..    4. We do not place dogs in homes where there are children under six years of age..    5. We have few dogs that are good with cats..    6. We rarely place terriers of the same sex together in one home (i.e., fighting)..    7. We never suggest that JRTs are suitable for metropolitan living..    8. We do not suggest placing terriers where the terrier must remain at home alone for extended periods of time..    9. All applicants are thoroughly screened and must meet certain qualifications before being referred for a terrier..   10. Compatible terriers may not be immediately available; your patience is appreciated..   11. Filling out an application does not guarantee that we will place a terrier with you..   12. All terriers in Rescue are spay/neutered..   13. A adoption fee to Russell Rescue, Inc. is required to adopt a terrier. . . . You Must Complete an Adoption Application. Please complete our online Russell Rescue, Inc. adoption application. All applicants are thoroughly screened and must meet certain qualifications before being referred for a terrier.. . Your Application will be Reviewed by Russell Rescue. The Russell Rescue, Inc. representative(s) assigned to your state will review your application. If your application is approved, you will be contacted as soon as possible by a Russell Rescue, Inc. representative. Please be patient.. .

Redondo Beach	CA	90278	United States	(805) 527-4096		adopt@foreverkees.org	http://www.foreverkees.org		Rescue	Keeshond dogs	Southern California	# The first step in adopting a dog is to complete an Adoption Application. Be specific in your answers to give us the best possible picture of your home and family. A volunteer will review your application and get back to you within five days. Due to the high volume of adoption applications, we use email to communicate initially during the screening process. Please remember to check your email for our response, and if you do not receive a reply to your application within five days, please email us.. . Sometimes we may have concerns regarding an application, and we reserve the right to deny an application if we feel there is a reason the home would not be appropriate for one of our Keeshond rescue dogs. If we will not be proceeding with your application, we will do our best to communicate this in a timely fashion. We receive many applications online each day, and we usually have several persons interested in a particular Keeshond rescue dog. We closely review each application, looking at the family's lifestyle, how much time they spend at home, yard size, current pets in the household, their previous pet history and their knowledge of dogs. We compare this to what we feel would be the best environment for the dog, considering his or her training and exercise needs, any medical needs, how the dog relates to children and other animals, etc. After considering each application, we choose the one that seems to be the best match for the dog. If your application is not chosen for the dog you are initially interested in, we suggest you visit our web site often, and email us if there is a different dog you think would be a good fit for your family..  . # A home visit is required for approval of an application and will be done prior to adoption. The volunteer visiting your home will check your fence and gates for security, and will make sure that there aren't any safety hazards or other concerns within the home. In addition, we want to make sure that each member of the household agrees to the adoption and that any current pets in the home are well cared for. Adoption fees range from $250 to $400 for a Keeshond dog.	SCKR is a small, all-volunteer organization. We do not have a shelter where people can come to meet dogs. All of our dogs are fostered in the homes of volunteers and are shown by appointment only to approved adopters.	rescue, placement	No	Yes

We are a growing rescue and as such, we are always learning and refining. Sometimes situations arise that we have not encountered and our policy in those situations is to look at the issue on a case by case basis and have a Board of Directors vote. Votes can sometimes take a couple days. The spirit of our policies is to ensure the forever part of forever home to the best of everyone's ability. We stand behind our dogs and want what is best for everyone involved.. .     * We cannot do one day adoptions. Due to the detailed nature of our process, it usually takes between two weeks and a month to get your dog home to you. The approval process takes around 5 days depending on many factors. We even require our foster parents and Board Members to submit an application with references to have on file in the event that they decide to adopt so that we have complete paperwork on file for every adoption..     * We keep applications on file and active for 6 months. After 6 months, we happily reactivate applications, but have to touch base to identify changes in the home (new pets, new vet, etc)..     * Applications are good for dogs in our program in general and not tied to particular dogs. If you do not see a dog on our website that you connect with, we encourage you to put in an application anyway - we get new dogs regularly..     * Adopters must be at least 18 years of age..     * All adults in the home must agree on the adoption of a collie..     * An adoption application must be completed and a non-refundable application fee of $10 paid to the rescue. If the prospective adopter adopts, then this application fee will be credited to your adoption fee of:.           o $175 for adult dogs.           o $225 for puppies under 6 months of age.           o $100 for scholarship dogs (denoted by a star on the website). .             This helps to defray the costs that we incur in the dog's vetting. It includes spay/neuter, heartworm test (and treatment if necessary), heartworm prevention while they are here, Rabies vaccine, distemper vaccine, bordatella vaccine, at least 2 dewormings, Flea Treatments while they are here, any necessary grooming, full vet exam, and any other necessary veterinary work deemed appropriate by the vet. In addition, senior dogs may receive extra bloodwork and dentals. .     * A fenced yard is a must for almost all collie homes. As a herding breed, collies can be car or animal chasers--it's a natural instinct. Board approval is required for collies to be adopted to homes without fences and a plan for the collie to be an indoor only dog with a leashed exercise plan will be expected. Please read this article on electric fencing to understand why we cannot approve homes that plan to leave dogs unattended in electric fences. Electric fencing used for supervised play may be considered on a case by case basis with Board approval..     * Adopter has a financial responsibility to their adopted collie to provide health care. They are expected to provide annual vaccinations and vet exams, monthly heart worm preventative, flea and tick preventative and vet care in emergencies and non-emergency situations that may arise..     * Adopter is expected to provide a good quality diet consisting of food that has good nutritional value and to stay away from ?bargain? dog food that may be detrimental to any canines health..     * Adopter's existing animals must be vaccinated per their Veterinarian's protocol..     * Collies can not be given as gifts to other families. You can give a donation fee towards an adoption..     * Until adopters are through our full approval process, we cannot reserve dogs..     * We cannot reserve dogs for longer than one week. During the approval process, we encourage the potential adopter to prepare their home, yard and lives in general for the arrival of a new family member whether it is from CCR or elsewhere. An additional week may be given on a case-by-case basis due to situations such as the installation of a fence. If an adopter will be out of town or has a vacation planned, we ask that the adopter wait until they return in order to inquire about dogs..     * Dogs are housed with individual foster parents. Interviewers will not give out foster parent telephone numbers or addresses without specific, written foster parent approval. Interviewers will put prospective adopters in touch with foster parents through email. Visits are arranged through the foster parents based on the foster parents availability and their choice of location (might be at foster home or at a park, etc)..     * Collies require a certain amount of grooming. They aren't extremely high-maintenance dogs, but an owner should plan on once weekly brushing and monthly bathing to maintain their beautiful coats..     * The pre-placement interview is for the adopter as much as it is for Collie Concern Rescue. We want to learn about what you want in your new family member in order to make the best possible match to your home. We will ask you lots of questions about your past experiences with dogs and other pets, what your current family dynamics are and your hopes for the future with your new dog. Expect for this conversation to take around an hour..     * An inspection of the new home may be requested to check the yard and environment and offer help if we see any stumbling blocks..     * If the prospective family meets all of the requirements for adoption, then they may begin inquiring about and meeting dogs in our program. If the adopter, the foster and the coordinators of Collie Concern all agree that a dog is a good fit for the family, a contract will be signed, the adoption fee will be paid to Collie Concern, and transportation will be arranged..     * On the day that the dog goes home, the adopter will meet at the prearranged location with a collar and a leash. The tags will be transferred, the paperwork given, pictures taken and maybe a few tears of happiness shed, and the dog will go home to live with his/her new family..     * Follow-up emails will be sent to make sure the dog is doing well. If there are any problems, mentors are available to help. Visits can be made to help with training difficulties. We will always be here for you. If for any reason the adoption does not work out, Collie Concern requires that the dog be returned to our organization (not given away or turned in to a shelter).. . 	Only after an application is fully approved and a prospective adoptive home has spoken to a foster parent and the dog seems to be a match so far, can the adoptive parent make arrangements to visit the dog.  Visits are scheduled at the convenience of both the prospective parent and the foster parent and at a place agreeable to both.	Adoption, behavioral help	No	Yes

We place dogs in homes with fenced yards, and require a contract to be. signed stating, among other things, that the dog be returned to rescue. should you, for any reason, no longer be able to keep him/her. Preference is given in order of best fit for the dog, the time an interest is expressed, and to some extent, geographic location. We only place dogs within the southeast states, but give preference, all other things being. equal, to an adopter near the foster home.. We do, in certain circumstances, place dogs with families who have young children, under 7 years of age, but in order to do so require that the dog's behavior with young children be evaluated in the foster home. Some of our. volunteers are able to do this, while others do not have that ability. The same is true for small pets such as cats. Some GSPs are fine with cats, but. we cannot assume so if they cannot be evaluated, as their prey drive often makes them incompatible with such pets.. While some rescued GSPs will hunt, we do not adopt them out to be. primarily hunting dogs. They should be family pets first, then hunters as a. bonus.

Approved Adopters are encouraged to participate in the matching process.  Finding a match may take a couple weeks or several months.  We want to set up both the adopter and the dog to succeed.  Generally, the more flexible you are, the faster the matching process. . . The Meet - After being matched with a dog, the potential adopter meets the foster dog, usually in the Foster Home.  Dogs already in the family should go along to this meet.. . Adoption - When you adopt, you get a copy of the Adoption Agreement, a copy of Foster Dog Information Form, rabies certificate, vaccination info. and copies of all Vet records.. . Post Adoption Follow-Up - The Foster Home will contact you shortly after adoption.  About 2 months after adoption, another L.E.A.R.N. volunteer will contact you to see how things are going and to see if you have any questions.. .

All adoptions are eligible for a $50 reimbursement if they attend a training class (any type class) within 6 months of adoption. . .

Our Process . . ???Our emphasis at Sheltie Shack Rescue is placed on the quality of our adoptions rather than quantity of adoptions completed.  We are not in the business of selling pets and as such we are not a cash and carry rescue.  When we refer to a fur ╤ever home we expect a lifelong commitment to the adoptive dog you have chosen to adopt.  Our adoption process is designed to help carefully match a pet with both your lifestyle and well as their individual needs in mind.  This can take some time, but using this method has produced a high success rate of happy adoptions.    Our goal is to have this be a happy and certainly the final happy home for our sheltie.    . . Adopting a New Companion????????????  . . If you are applying for one of our dogs from out of state, please note that we  DO NOT SHIP OUR DOGS.  If you are truly interested in adopting from Sheltie Shack Rescue you must be willing to make the trip to meet us and your potential new family member.  We expect the entire family to come, including any other current canine companions, as there is no other way to assure compatibility of all family members.  We have had many successful out of state adoptions and encourage you to apply if you can comply with these travel requirements.  We do not place our dogs in homes where current pets are not properly vaccinated, not on heartworm preventative or not  spayed or neutered unless there is a medical reason for not doing so or the dog is actively being shown in conformation.  We only place dogs in homes where they will be indoor pets and never left outdoors when no one is home.  For all puppies and nearly all of our adult dogs, a fenced yard is required.  On occasion we may have a well socialized, leash trained adult or senior sheltie that will do fine in a condo/town house/apartment environment where a responsible adopter will agree that all outside activities will ONLY take place on a leash.  This such determination will be made on a case by case basis.  We do NOT approve of electric/invisible fences, dog runs or tie out chains.  Shelties adopted from us must be kept on heartworm preventative (Interceptor, no Ivermectin based products).. . How to Submit an Application .  .  Apply online.   .  Download an application (MS Word).   .  We will review the application, and will contact you by phone and/or e-mail with any questions we might have.  If your written application is approved, a home visit will be scheduled next.  Since we often have volunteers do our home visits, we will contact you after getting their report and let you know if you've been approved to come meet the dog(s) of interest and hopefully adopt your next family companion.  If your application is not approved upon initial submittal, we will let you know within the next 24 hours or if at any time during the adoption process we feel you are not a good fit for the dog you are interested in, for whatever reason, you will also be notified per phone or e-mail. .  .  Adoption fees cover the spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, heart worm testing (treatment if necessary), dentals (when necessary) and worming. Other medical needs are addressed on a per need basis of each individual dog.  You will find that our fee is considerably less expensive than going to the vet yourself with a newly purchased dog from a breeder because our vets support rescue and provide reduced rates for their services.  Although we ask for a minimum adoption fee, we are always appreciative of any additional donation that helps defray costs such as travel expenses, food, bedding, toys and grooming services that are not factored into the adoption fee as well as set monthly operational expenditures.  . .  An Adoption Contract for each dog will be signed as the last step of the adoption process. The contract is a binding and legal document that provides for returning the dog to Sheltie Shack Rescue if the adopter is no longer able to keep dog and allows for quick reclaim if there is abuse; the animal is found roaming free; or the dog is suffering from neglect.  You can expect a follow up inquiry as to how the adopted dog is doing and, hopefully, you would like to share your success story with us to post on the web.    . . Where To See Our Dogs  . . . Since we do not operate a shelter facility, only approved applicants will be invited to come and meet the dog(s) they are interested in and approved to adopt.  Since not all dogs are located at the same foster home, arrangements will be made on an individual bases as to where this meeting will take place and where the adoption will be completed..

Through a careful screening process, we place loving dogs into forever homes with compassionate individuals and families. We begin with an Application, which tells us more about an individual?  experience level, lifestyle, other pets, preferences, etc. so we can recommend dogs that best fit the home. Prospective adopters are encouraged to meet various dogs and to bring all family members and existing pets to meet the dogs they are interested in. Once ?the? dog has been selected, we perform a routine Home Visit to ensure the dog will be safe from any hazards, poisons, or dangerous situations. At this time, we advise the adopter if there are any repairs or corrections that need to be made prior to the dog coming home. Adopters pledge to love and care for the adopted dog throughout its entire lifetime. In the event an adopter is no longer able to care for a dog, we insist it come back into our rescue safety net for re-homing. Due to financial and logistical limitations, we do not place dogs outside of the Southern California area..  . Our minimum Adoption Donation is $350 plus $25.00 for microchip for dogs over 1 year, and $450 plus $25.00 for microchip for dogs one year old and younger.

Camp Papillon Adoption Process & Policy. . The goal of Camp Papillon is to place our companion animals in lifetime, loving homes. Every home and every companion animal has it 's own unique personality and requirements. We place our animals in the supportive and loving environment of home foster care. While there, we gain knowledge about their personality, training skills, likes and dislikes.. . To assist us with matching the correct companion animal with the most appropriate and compatible home,please email us the answers to the below questions and any other information you think would be helpful. The emailed information may be followed-up by a Camp Papillon Adoption Coordinator, with a phone interview and then a home check.. . Adoption contract and post adoption follow-up checks are required as a condition of adoption. Some companion animals get multiple applicants or are not appropriate matches, so not all adoptions will be approved. Not all applicants will receive a yes or no response due to limited staff. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification. . . . Our Adoption Costs. Dogs: $250. Puppies:$300. Puppies $50 Refund after proof of spay/neuter. Cats: $75. Kittens: $100. Kittens $25 Refund after proof of spay / neuter. Rabbits, Ferrets, etc: $25. . Why the high cost? Can't I adopt an animal for less? No.. and here's why: Our animals come fully vetted. It costs us less for medical care then you due to non-profit discount. So if you adopt an animal for less it will cost you more later.

Fill out the adoption questionnaire located below and submit it to us. Once we have reviewed/approved your application, we will contact you to arrange a Meet & Greet. Many of our dogs are in private volunteer foster homes. We must schedule a one-on-one Meet & Greet appointment with each individual dog. It takes time to schedule these appointments, however we do have a standard weekly adoption event at local Petco's, where we show dogs for adoption. We can arrange to have the foster's bring the dog to the Petco. This is the easiest way to set up a Meet & Greet. These adoptions events are usually Saturday or Sunday.. . When going to a Meet & Greet, please make sure you take any family members and other dogs to see how the initial introduction goes. That makes the entry into the new home easier for the dog and for you.. . How it Works:. . If your Meet & Greet goes well, you will complete an adoption contract at the appointment and can take the dog home then. We ask for a suggested adoption donation* to help us cover spay/neutering, shots, medical treatment, food, and supplies. Then you and your new best friend live happily ever after. It's as simple as that! *Baja Dog Rescue is a 501c(3) non-profit and all donations go directly to the care of our dogs and are 100% tax deductible. The suggested adoption donations only partially cover the cost of the expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs.. . What if the adoption doesn't work out?. . We have a lifetime return policy on our dogs as we don't want to see them turned back into a shelter. The application process helps prevent such an issue, so it's very important that you are honest when answering the questions. Not all dogs are compatible in all situations, so it is imperative that you are forthright in the application process to find the right match. However, be sure you are ready to make a full commitment to adopting a dog, whether a puppy or an adult. It can take a good 72 hrs for a dog to really adjust to his/her new environment. A lot really depends on the dog's past so the prospect of adopting should be well-thought-out & the commitment should be taken seriously.	We are always doing adoption events throughout the San Diego County area at a local Petco. We are at one almost every weekend with wonderful dogs that need loving homes.	adoptions, rescue	No	Yes

They fill out a detailed application. It then needs to be approved - same day, but it is not first-come first-serve, we aim to find the best possible match. The contract states that if for any reason the adopter does not want the animal anymore, they are required to surrender them back to SCSPCA and not a municipal shelter. It states that dogs cannot be outdoor only, no declawing on cats, and several other things. All our animals are fully vetted, vaccinated, and spayed or neutered before being adopted out. The fee is $200 for puppies under 6 months of age and $175 for dogs older than 6 months; $125 for kittens under 6 months of age and $100 for cats older than 6 months. Includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and heartworm preventative for dogs, Felv / FIV test for cats; all animals current on flea preventative..

4833	Available	Genesis Dog Rescue		BELLEVILLE	on	K8N 4M1	Canada			genesisdogrescue@gmail.com	http://www.genesisdogrescue.com	http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002515738496	Rescue	dogs	Ottawa area	Adoption Process Explained. . Genesis Dog Rescue does not adopt out dogs on a first come, first serve basis. Because we want this to be a permanent adoption, we will place the dog in the home best suited for him/her. We will not hold dogs for homes that are not ready to adopt yet or have not yet been approved.. . Genesis Dog Rescue is 100% spay/neuter before adoption. We do NOT make exceptions so please do not ask. If we have puppies available (which is rare), they will be available to go to an adoptive home with a contract stating their spay/neuter date, which must be kept, failure to do so, will result in immediate return of the adopted dog with no refund. (this is non negotiable) They will also have an increased adoption fee.. . Genesis Dog Rescue's does not adopt further then 2 hours from Ottawa. A home visit is absolutely required. If we have no one to do that home visit, we cannot adopt to that person. We have to visit and verify and counsel with each potential adopter. When we do the visits we often see something that needs to be addressed that the applicant might not think to mention. If an adoption doesn't click and the new home is far from the foster homes, it makes it extremely complicated and difficult to retrieve the animal and get him to either the original or another foster home.. . Here is what you need to do... Submit an online adoption application. Once you submit the application, you will receive an email or a phone call from the volunteer, who will ask you any further information, that is required from the application, and will schedule a time with you to do a home visit, should your application be approved.. . We verify personal and vet references that are given on your online adoption application. A home visit is scheduled for your family. A home visit is mandatory for all adopters. This will involve a rescue volunteer coming to your home and visiting with you. All family members and pets must be present at the time of the visit. If you refuse a home visit, your application will be declined. Once your home visit is completed, your application and home visit report will then be forwarded to the Board of Directors who will either approve or decline your application for adoption. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption. We will notify you of your adoption status We will require you to sign our adoption contract and pay an adoption fee of $300.00 to $400.00 but this can and will vary depending on the dog you are adopting. The adoption fee is listed in each dog's bio. Fees can and will increase for puppies due to the extra vet work that we must perform on them. This will help other dogs in need, just as the one you are adopting.. . Adoption Information: These are a few things to remember when looking to adopt a dog from us. These are only a few of our requirements, not all of them:. .     Be an adult with responsibility for maintaining a household (no students)..     Have current identification showing address and/or phone number..     Have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in household..     Be able to spend the time and money necessary to provide for the training, medical treatment and proper care of the pet..     Have the resources to make a non-refundable adoption fee..     Agree to provide the pet with an indoor home and be willing to consider him as a member of the family..     Understand that all Genesis Dog Rescue's dogs are spayed/neutered, no exceptions..     Understand that all pets in an adopter's home must be spayed/neutered, no exceptions..     Understand that children's age restriction will be based on their exposure to and experience with the breed..     Place personal ID on the pet as soon as possible..     Provide an environment for the animal that will keep him safe and secure..     Understand that Genesis Dog Rescue has the right to either deny or approve your adoption application without explanation.. . A Few Points To Remember: You may not be contacted until there is a dog available that might be a good match for you. Every dog will not fit into every household. It is left to the discretion of the Board of Directors, whether to approve a placement. We do not adopt out dogs to be given as gifts. If someone you know would like a dog, have that person fill out the application form. You could offer to pay the adoption fee if you would like it to be a gift.. . . We have an adoption application and adoption contract, there is a home visit and references to be done before an adoption can be considered.	All of our dogs are in foster homes, no meet and greet will be arranged before an applicaiton is received and the adoption process is started, due to the fact that we are foster based.	adoptions, spay/neuter, vaccinations, HW meds, deworming ...

4929	Available	Sentinel Dog Rescue	14a spring grove lane	nepean	on	K2J 2C6	Canada			sentineldogrescue@gmail.com	http://	http://www.facebook.com/sentineldogrescue	Rescue	dogs	Ottawa, Ontario	Adoption Process. Sentinel Dog Rescue does not adopt out dogs on a first come, first serve basis. Because we want this to be a permanent adoption, we will place the dog in the home best suited for him/her. We will not hold dogs for homes that are not ready to adopt yet or have not yet been approved. . . Sentinel Dog Rescue is 100% spay/neuter before adoption. We do NOT make exceptions so please do not ask. If we have puppies available (which is rare), they will be available to go to an adoptive home with a contract stating their spay/neuter date, which must be kept, failure to do so, will result in immediate return of the adopted dog with no refund. (this is non negotiable) They will also have an increased adoption fee. . . Sentinel Dog Rescue's does not adopt further then 2 hours from Ottawa. A home visit is absolutely required. If we have no one to do that home visit, we cannot adopt to that person. We have to visit and verify and counsel with each potential adopter. When we do the visits we often see something that needs to be addressed that the applicant might not think to mention. If an adoption doesn't click and the new home is far from the foster homes, it makes it extremely complicated and difficult to retrieve the animal and get him to either the original or another foster home. . . Here is what you need to do... Submit an online adoption application. Once you submit the application, you will receive an email or a phone call from the volunteer, who will ask you any further information, that is required from the application, and will schedule a time with you to do a home visit, should your application be approved.. . We verify personal and vet references that are given on your online adoption application. A home visit is scheduled for your family. A home visit is mandatory for all adopters. This will involve a rescue volunteer coming to your home and visiting with you. All family members and pets must be present at the time of the visit. If you refuse a home visit, your application will be declined. Once your home visit is completed, your application and home visit report will then be forwarded to the Board of Directors who will either approve or decline your application for adoption. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption. We will notify you of your adoption status We will require you to sign our adoption contract and pay an adoption fee of $500. The adoption fee is listed in each dog's bio. Fees can and will increase for puppies due to the extra vet work that we must perform on them. This will help other dogs in need, just as the one you are adopting. . . Adoption Information: These are a few things to remember when looking to adopt a dog from us. These are only a few of our requirements, not all of them: . ??  Be an adult with responsibility for maintaining a household (no students). . ??  Have current identification showing address and/or phone number. . ??  Have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in household. . ??  Be able to spend the time and money necessary to provide for the training, medical treatment and proper care of the pet. . ??  Have the resources to make a non-refundable adoption fee. . ??  Agree to provide the pet with an indoor home and be willing to consider him as a member of the family. . ??  Understand that all Sentinel Dog Rescue's dogs are spayed/neutered, no exceptions. . ??  Understand that all pets in an adopter's home must be spayed/neutered, no exceptions. . ??  Understand that children's age restriction will be based on their exposure to and experience with the breed. . ??  Place personal ID on the pet as soon as possible. . ??  Provide an environment for the animal that will keep him safe and secure. . ??  Understand that Sentinel Dog Rescue's has the right to either deny or approve your adoption application without explanation.. A Few Points To Remember: You may not be contacted until there is a dog available that might be a good match for you. Every dog will not fit into every household. It is left to the discretion of the Board of Directors, whether to approve a placement. We do not adopt out dogs to be given as gifts. If someone you know would like a dog, have that person fill out the application form. You could offer to pay the adoption fee if you would like it to be a gift. 	all our adoptables are in foster homes, and therefore can not be visited until the home is approved after our adoption screening process is complete.	adoptions	No	Yes

Most often you will need to drive to the area of the foster home, but if we can arrange transportation to you to meet the pup, we will do our best.. .  . . **We will discuss with you how the meet & greet went.. .  . . **Once approved to adopt a particular pup, we will contact you with the news. You then have 24-48 hrs to discuss it with your family. You must then contact an NELR rep within this 24-48 hr timeframe if you do decide to adopt. This is very important as the details of arranging transport of the rescued dog will need to be made, often times we have several people involved in this process and we need to plan around multiple schedules. If we do not hear from you in this 24-48 hr time period, we will assume you have changed your mind, your application will be voided, and we will move on to other applicants.. .  . . **We will then work with you to either pick up your new pup, or arrange transportation to get the pup to you.. .  . . ** Lastly, you will sign our adoption contract and the adoption fee will be required upon your taking ownership of the pup.. .  . . Things to Remember:. .  . . **Our goal is to find the best match based on the Labs background and the familys needs. The temperament and energy level of the dog are our most important consideration. We consider factors in the home, including the ages of the children, ages of pets in the home and what type of other pets are in your home. We never base our adoption process on who gets their application in first, instead we weigh all applications to find the best suited family for the pup's needs based on our assessments of our dogs. Our number one goal is to be 100% committed to every dog we rescue.. .  . . **If you apply for a certain dog, we will do our best to see if that particular pup is a good fit, but there are times when, for many different reasons, that it might not be a good match. That does not mean there is anything wrong with your application, just that that particular dog requires different needs. Should you not be applying for a specific dog, the Adoption Coordinator will talk with you about which dogs best fit your home and lifestyle.. .  . . **Please understand that although filling out an application is the first step in the process, filling out the application in and of itself does not guarantee that you will be able to adopt a particular pup...again many different factors go into our decisions, and our number one goal is to find the best suited family for that dog, with the goal being that none of our rescue dogs ever find themselves homeless again. Also please do not fill out an application and share with your children that you are adopting that particular dog, as it is not a guarantee until you receive confirmation from the Adoption Coordinator that you are approved to adopt a particular rescued dog. NELR does reserve the right to deny any application for any reason.. .  . . **At the time of adoption, we will provide you with copies of the Labs medical history and any information from the previous owner if available.. .  . . **The adoption donation for a Rescue Lab is $350. For Labs under the age of 1 year, the Adoption donation is $375. For seniors over 7 yrs of age there is a reduced adoption donation of between $100-$200. Full payment is required at the time of adoption. This is an all volunteer organization, so all adoption fees and donations go right back into rescuing more labs in urgent need!. .  . . **Families with children 10 years old or younger must have a fenced-in area.. .  . . **We do not place Labs in families with children unless we know the dog has a positive. .  experience with children.. .  . . **We do not place Rescue Labs with families that run a home-based childcare or doggie. .  daycare program.. .  . . **All current dogs in an applicant's home must be up-to-date on all vaccines, including the Bordetella vaccine (kennel cough.) They also must be treated monthly with Heartgard or a similar heartworm preventative.. .  . . **Finally please understand that all of us put many hours into helping NELR each week, but we are all volunteers, with our own families, jobs, our own dogs, often times foster dogs, etc...We work very hard at saving these beautiful labs, but we can't always make everyone happy with our placement choices. If a dog you were interested in is ultimately placed with a different adoptive family, please do not take it personally. Again it does not mean that there was anything wrong with your application, more that it wasn't the right placement for the dog. We always have other beautiful labs available for adoption, which we will be happy to discuss with you and might be just perfect for your family.. .  . . Post Adoption. .  . . **First and Foremost, please remember that all rescue pups need to be given a period of time to adjust to their new home, bond with their new family, and possibly relearn some manners. They may have already proven to be successful with house training for example, but once again are in a new place and are now confused & possibly scared until they settle in. They dont arrive at a new home knowing which door they should use to go out, who to alert to, etc...they need to be trained with the new house rules and to learn what is and isnt allowed. These pups have been through a lot, and need lots of love, consistency and set boundaries. Some rescue pups walk into their new homes and it is like they have always been there, others may take a few weeks to a few months to really settle in.. .  . . **Volunteers will be available to help you with problems and concerns, and to answer. .  any questions.. .  . . **If, for any reason, the adoption is not satisfactory, the Lab must be returned to NELR as stated in the Adoption Agreement.. .  . . **New England Lab Rescue reserves the right to take possession of a Rescue Lab that is. .  neglected, improperly cared for, develops a serious temperament problem, or is allowed to run loose.. .  . . Thank You for Considering New England Lab Rescue.	We try to schedule meet and greets once applicants are approved, but locations do not always match up	Adoptions	No	Yes

The application requests information about your situation, what sort of dog you wish to adopt, including age and behavior. We welcome applications from potential adopters who are able to love a dog with special physical or behavioral needs. No one is asked to adopt a dog with issues they cannot handle.. . While we usually experience a steady flow of incoming Boston Terriers needing to be re-homed, we also have a steady flow of people and families seeking to adopt a Boston Terrier through AZBTR.  We file applications, more or less, in order of receipt.  As we anticipate new dogs coming into our rescue, we attempt to fulfill those applications.  This is not always the case, however.  Our goal is to match our dogs to the best suited homes based on the individual dog's needs.. . If acquiring a dog is a time sensitive issue for you or your family, rescue may not be for you.  If you are willing to wait for the right rescue to come to you, you are an ideal candidate for AZBTR.  It could be days, weeks, or months before we find a Boston Terrier that we feel is a good match for you.  As our success rate proves, these precious dogs are well worth the wait. . . We carefully screen potential adoptive families, including interviewing adopters, checking references, and visiting homes. We prefer that adoptive homes have fenced yards because we do not place dogs in situations where they will be chained out or allowed to run loose. During the home visit we look for potential hazards for the Boston that the adopter may not have considered.. . During the interview phase, we are very interested to know about other pets potential adopters have or have had. Have they ever lost a pet or had one euthanized? Why? Do they have a history of lifetime commitment to their pets? How long will the dog be left alone each day and in what circumstances? Their answers to these questions help us understand if they have a history of long term commitment to their pets and they think carefully of the pets' well being.. . We want adopters to be happy with their adopted Boston, too, so we learn as much as we can about the dog's history and temperament: is he/she good with children, other dogs, cats? Everyone needs to be happy as a result of the adoption process.. . We are very careful about the placements we make. We do our best to match the right Boston with the right adoptive home, because we want this to be the dog's permanent home.. . Adopters sign a Placement Contract with us, agreeing among other things to return the dog to us if they are not able to keep it themselves.. . The Adoption Fee is based on the age of the Boston, as follows:. Age of Boston           Fee. Up to 12 months   $300. 1-3 years                  $275. 4-8 years                   $250. 9 years and older   $150. . The Adoption Fee includes the health and ID services mentioned above. Additional medical expenses may be passed on to the adopter, based on negotiations with the adopter. We are open to discussing a lower adoption fee for senior Bostons, for adoption of more than one dog, or for adopters willing to take on a dog with an ongoing health issue. This fee schedule is in effect for Bostons adopted after June 17, 2006.. . 	All of our adoptable dogs are in the care of foster families so we offer adoption events throughout the valley.

APPLICATION. . The first step to be considered to adopt a dog through Echo Dogs White Shepherd Rescue is to complete an application.  The Application can be found at the Adoption drop-down menu on the navigation bar above or by clicking here:  Echo Dogs Application Form. . The application is sent electronically to our processing team, where references are checked.  (Yes, we really do call your references!). . REFERENCES. . We will call and speak with references listed on your application.  The information provided to us by your references is kept strictly confidential.  We believe that we get honest information by assuring references that we will not disclose to anyone the content of our conversations.. . You should call your references to let them know that they may be contacted by Echo Dogs.  Occasionally, we have encountered some references, such as veterinarians, who are reluctant to speak with us unless they have your permission.  It is easier for all of us if you let them know to expect our call.. . No application can be approved without veterinary and personal references.. . HOME VISIT. . After your application has passed through the reference checks, we will work to get a home visit set up.  Either an Echo Dogs volunteer or someone who has agreed to help us (usually another rescue group or animal shelter volunteer) will contact you to set up the home visit.  We will contact you to let you know who will be working with you to find a mutually-convenient time for conducting the home visit.. . Home visits are not scary!!  This is often the most nerve-wracking part of our application approval process -- but it needn't be.  The home visit is designed to accomplish three main goals:  1.  To verify that the information provided on the application is true and accurate; 2.  To determine whether the home has the ability to provide a safe, loving environment for a dog through Echo Dogs; and 3.  To help determine the personality of the dog that would best suit the home and family.. .  . MATCHING DOGS. . After your application has passed all reference checks and the home visit, you are approved to adopt one of our dogs!  However, not every dog is appropriate for every home.  We will work with you to find the dog that is best suited for your home, family and lifestyle.  We want you to get a dog that will enrich your life and delight you and we want each one of our dogs to have a home and family that thinks he or she is the absolute best dog on the planet. . . Our Adoption Coordinator takes over at this point in the process.  She will look at your application and home visit report and will send your application to the foster home that has a dog she thinks you might be interested in.  The foster home will either call or e-mail you with some information about the dog.  You should ask as many questions as you feel necessary to understand whether this dog is the one for you.  If you don't think one sounds just right, just let the foster home or the Adoption Coordinator know and we will look for a different dog.  If you can tell us why a particular dog didn't appeal to you, it will help us look at other dogs in our program that might be more suitable.. . Please do not feel pressured to adopt any dog that you aren't absolutely comfortable about adopting!  Each of us loves our foster dogs, but we realize that he or she might not be the right dog for every family or home.  We do not feel offended or hurt if you decide you would rather adopt a dog other than our personal foster dog.  After all, our goal is to get our foster dog into a home where she or he will be truly treasured.. I WANT THIS DOG.... . When you have found the dog that you want to adopt, let the foster home or the Adoption Coordinator know and the Adoption Coordinator will work with you to finalize the adoption.. . ...BUT HE'S SO FAR AWAY. . We understand that our dogs are often in places far away from the adopters.  Depending on the distances involved, we have various options available, which we can discuss prior to finalize the adoption.  Bear in mind, that the transportation, depending on the distances involved, the speed with which you want to receive the dog and sometimes just plain luck, may involve some additional expense and almost always require you to drive some distance to pick up the dog..  . . DONATION. . We ask for each of our adopters to make a minimum donation to Echo Dogs to adopt one of our dogs.  Currently, we request a minimum of $300, which is roughly equivalent to the average veterinary expenses we spend on our dogs.. . WHAT'S INCLUDED. .  . Each of our dogs, at the time of adoption, will be current on their vaccinations (DHPP, rabies and bordatella), have a negative heartworm test and fecal exam, will have been spayed or neutered and have a microchip implanted.  We keep each of our dogs on Heartgard or Interceptor and Frontline Plus while in foster care. . . Many of our dogs have received considerably more medical treatment than the above, depending on what they need when they arrive into foster care.  If a dog has a chronic condition that is diagnosed while in our care, we will inform you of the diagnosis and the course of treatment that the dog has been receiving while in our care. . .  . WHEN IN DOUBT, JUST ASK. . We gladly answer any questions about our process, or any of our dogs.  Just ask! 	www.echodogs.org	Adoptions/spay/neuter/microchip/fully vetted	No	Yes

Counties: Citrus, Marion, Hernando, Sumter, Lake, Seminole, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands,Okeechobee, Sarasota, Desoto, Charlotte, Lee, and Collier.	Applicant applies to adopt.  Volunteers does a vet check to make sure all current or previous animals are UTD on shots, HW prevention and spayed or neutered.  We also ask the vet/vet tech if s/he believes the applicant should have a boxer.  Then we do a property check to make sure the applicant owns his/her home or that the landlord is OK with the applicant having a boxer.  If there is a HOA or COA then we make sure that Boxers are OK.  Then we call the applicant for a phone interview.  If the phone interview goes well then we do a home interview.  If that goes well the applicant is approved to adopt one of boxers and everyone will go meet the dog(s) they're interested in adopting.  Once they find the right match they sign a contract and pay the adoption fee.  The adoption fees range in price depending upon the age of the dog.  The adoption fee is decided by the Board of Directors if the boxer is under a year old(it largely depends on the vetting costs).  A year to 6 years is $250, and dogs over seven have a $175 adoption fee.  If we ever get boxer mixes, those dogs have a $150 adoption fee.	All of our boxers are in foster homes.  So when an applicant is approved, they are contacted by the foster parent of the dog they want to meet.  The applicant travels to the boxer to see him/her in his/her environment.  We also have meet & greets about every other month.  Some of the boarding facilities throughout the state allow us to come in when they're closed (usually Sundays) and bring our boxers and invite approved applicants to meet the available boxers.  These have proven very successful recently due to the number of dogs we bring into rescue.	Adoptions, spay/neuter, surrenders, medical treatment, behavior assessments, pull from shelters, etc	No	Yes

We rescue animals from all over the state of California as well as complete full scale rescues all over the country as well as over seas.	  Adoption Procedures:. . Our mission is to find the best possible homes for the animals in our care. Many of them have been through severe hardship, mistreatment or neglect, and that makes it even more important that we do our best for them. This means that we have to have guidelines because not every adopter is right for every animal. We try to do right by every person who comes our way looking for a new family pet. But sometimes we have to say  no  to a potential adopter. Our animals do not have a say in where they go; since we speak for those who have no voice, we must do it well. Our rejection of an adoption application is no reflection on the adopter. Everyone who wants to adopt an animal from a shelter or rescue group is special because they open their homes to those in need. But, while we try to meet the needs of everyone, our clients are the animals. They have no one else. We appreciate your understanding.. .   Get acquainted: We recommend spending no less than an hour of one-on-one time; this helps to ensure compatibility.. .     Housing Requirements: If you rent, we require a copy of your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to have the animal you are interested in.  This letter needs to be on your landlord's letterhead, and with appropriate contact information to verify the pets-allowed policy.. .     Bring your existing dog(s) if you are adopting another one:  We want to make sure your existing pet loves your new friend as much as you do. Meeting on neutral territory will make the selection and introduction process that much easier.  Please do not bring your own dog(s) into the building; this would put them at risk of exposure to communicable diseases.  If you have cats at home, we will do a cat test with our feline shelter residents.  Often dogs in a new environment will not display a prey drive towards cats during the first couple of weeks of acclimation; this test is only meant to indicate to us an immediate failure if the dog shows aggression.. .      All family members and/or roommates must meet the animal: Some small children are allergic to cats or dogs, but their parents are not aware of it yet. Some elderly family members can't handle the size or activity level of some of our canine guests. Some animals get along perfectly with one person, yet may act aggressive toward another.  Bringing everyone who will be a part of the family or the household is critical to the success of the adoption.  Please note that we do not adopt animals out to anyone under the age of 21.. .     A home check may or may not be required: Each adoption process will vary due to the needs of the particular animal and background of the applicant. If a home check is needed, we will set up a convenient time to meet with you at your home.. .     The adoption process: We do not start adoption processes within an hour of closing, and we do not hold animals.  The paperwork itself takes just a few minutes, but the adoption process could last up to 1-2 hours depending on the animal you want to take home and the availability of an adoption counselor. During busier times, especially such as weekends, there can be many adoptions in progress; we ask for your patience if you have to wait during this step as we only have a limited number of staff.  If you are adopting a cat, you will need to bring a carrier.. .    Adoption fees: Kittens under 6 months of age are $150; all other cats are $110.  Puppies under 1 year of age are $300; dogs over 1 year are $200, senior dogs are $150.  Fees can only be paid by check, cash, or debit card; we do not allow payment plans and we cannot take credit cards.  (NOTE: Only an amount over the adoption fee is tax deductible).  . . All dogs in Santa Cruz County are required by law to be licensed; fees start at $28 for one year. License fees should be paid with a separate check made out to SCCASA.  Adoption fees are NOT refundable.. .  ** The Santa Cruz SPCA reserves the right to deny ANY adoption for ANY reason ** . . All of our animals must be spayed / neutered before they go home. . . If they are not already altered, you will be able to pick your new pet up within a few days.. . Please note that most of the animals in our center come to us with unknown medical histories.  The Santa Cruz SPCA makes every effort to adopt out only healthy animals; however, we cannot guarantee the health of the animal you decide to adopt.

If you would like to adopt one of our needy dogs, the fastest and most efficient way to be considered is to fill out an online application, and send it to us as soon as possible. The application will be reviewed by members of CSAC Placement team. The review process includes a background check, and whenever appropriate, a check and verification of the veterinary history of the applicant's present or previously owned animals. If the application is approved, we will contact the applicant by phone or email to set up a home visit. A home visit will be scheduled at a mutually convenient time.  If all goes well, the approved applicant can schedule a meet and greet with the dog they are interested in adopting. The final stage of the adoption process is filling out the Adoption Agreement, which is signed by the adopter(s) and a CSAC representative.. . Adoption fees:. $400 - puppy to 1 year 11 months,. $350 - 2 years to 4 years 11 months,. $300 - 5 years to 8 years 11 months,. $250 - 9 years and older. Adoption fees are required to help offset the large expenses incurred caring for the dogs. On average, the adoption fee covers 60% of the expenses.. . By the time of adoption, all dogs have been examined at least once by one or more board certified veterinarians. The dogs move into their forever homes having had all the treatment and care we can adequately determine they need, including -- but not limited to -- vaccinations, spaying and neutering and heartworm tests. Everything possible is done to reasonably ensure the health and well-being of our dogs.. . Every attempt is made to assess the temperament and behavior of the animals, and they will be as socialized as possible under the circumstances. We are honest with potential adopters about our dogs, and all available information is disclosed. We make no guarantees about the health or temperament of any of our rescue dogs, as we often know so little of their history, but we do all we can to determine and take care of as much as possible under the circumstances. Our primary objective is to see these formerly unfortunate animals placed in safe, secure homes, where they will be loved and accepted as family members for the rest of their lives.. .

If you want a special lifetime companion, please view our list of adoptable animals.

Adopting a Companion from Sea Dog Rescue. . We are so pleased that you are considering adopting a companion from our rescue and would like you to know what to expect from this process.  Our companions are special dogs who have not had the greatest start in life but who are willing and happy to  forgive and forget  and give all of their love to another human.  Because of this we want our companions to have the best of homes where they will receive the love, attention, exercise, and the health care they deserve.  We provide full age appropriate vet care for all of our companions prior to adoption.  We require all of our companions to be spayed or neutered.. . Our Adoption Criteria. . We want our companions to be adopted by animal lovers who have given ample consideration to the responsibilities associated with providing a wonderful, fulfilling home.   Our adoption criterion includes, but is not limited to, the following:. .    Consideration should be given to the time commitment needed to care for and teach your new companion the  rules of the house ..    Consideration should also be given to the financial responsibility of providing for items that help to make your home, their home   for example, a dog bed, crate, collar, leash, personal food bowls, toys, etc. are all items you should provide for your companion in his or her new home..    Careful consideration should be given to the costs associated with, and the careful choice of, a veterinarian to provide routine veterinary care as well as unexpected care in the event of illness or accidents.  We ask for a veterinarian reference on our application however, we understand that some folks may be adopting for the first time and therefore may not have a current veterinarian, or perhaps have not had a companion recently and thus may not have a current veterinarian.  The lack of a vet reference will not automatically disqualify an applicant, however we do ask that adopters do their homework with respect to choosing a veterinarian prior to adopting and are able to provide us the name of the veterinarian or clinic they intend to use for their companions healthcare..    Additionally, we insist on positive training methods only.  Use of pinch collars, choke chains, electric shock collars, prong collars, and hitting/slapping the dog or yelling at the dog is expressly prohibited..    Our companions are adopted as indoor pets only   we do not allow our companions to go to homes where they will be  tied out  in the yard or left alone in a fenced yard for long periods of time.. . Please note: we are unable to approve applications from applicants under 21 years of age.. . Our Adoption Process. . Because we work diligently to place our companions in a home that is a perfect fit for both the companion and the adopter, our adoption process has several steps.. .   The first step in the adoption process is completing an Adoption Application.  Your application may be scanned and emailed to our rescue email account at prbford@roadrunner.com or faxed to 252-679-7298.  Alternately, you may mail your application to:. Sea Dog Rescue. 128 Birdie Lane. Elizabeth City, NC 27909. .   Once we have received your application we will review it to see if you meet our adoption criteria.  This determination is based on the information provided on your application as well as a telephone interview.  If you have provided a veterinary reference you should be sure to call their office and give them permission to speak with us, otherwise they are legally bound not to give any information about your animals vet history.  If you currently have pet(s) we do expect that they are current on their vaccinations and they are spayed or neutered, provided they are at least 6 months of age.  We may receive several applications for the same companion and we do not base our approval on the order in which the applications are received.  We review each application thoroughly and make our decision based on what we feel is the best fit for the companion and the potential adopter.  Your submission of an Adoption Application is not a guarantee of adoption for that companion and we reserve the right to decline any application for any reason.. .   After your application has been approved we require a Home Visit Check.  We want to see where our companions will be living and ensure that it is a safe, homey environment for them.  Our companions are adopted strictly as indoor companions and are not intended to live outdoors or be left on a chain or tether in your yard.  Home visit checks are scheduled at the convenience of the adopter and the Sea Dog Rescue representative performing the home visit check; pictures of the home environment may be required and are strictly for Sea Dog Rescue use and are never shared in any fashion.. .   In cases where it is possible, we will arrange for a  meet and greet  with the companion.  Since foster homes are scarce and we work with many shelters in various locations our companions may not be local to your area.  If you wish to drive to the foster home for a meet and greet we encourage you to do so however, for the safety of our companions and their foster caregivers, this is done only after your application has been approved.  If you are too far from the foster caregivers home for a meet and greet, we can put you in touch with them via telephone to learn more about the companions daily schedule, behaviors, etc.. .   The last step of our process is payment of the adoption fee and the review and signing of an Adoption Agreement. . . Getting Your New Companion from His/Her Foster Home to Their New Home. . Sea Dog Rescue may be able to provide transportation, at no extra charge, for your new furry family member from their foster home to their new forever home, no matter the distance, via ground or air transport.  A Sea Dog Rescue representative will always deliver your new family member to his or her new home and you will receive all necessary vet records and travel documents.. . Adoption Fees. . Adoption fees vary for each individual companion and are based on variables such as the routine veterinary care required prior to adoption, medical conditions that require specialty veterinary care, medical conditions that require extended treatment, and age of the companion.  Adoption fees are payable by personal check, bank check or cash; if paying by check, please make it payable to ?Sea Dog Rescue?.. Adoption fees for Sea Dogs average $150.00 to $300.00 (USD).. . What services does my adoption fee cover and what is the customary fee for these services?. . Services covered  Usual and Customary Charges. Medical evaluation from a veterinarian  $35 - $50. Puppy Vaccinations (Series of 3 vaccinations)  $47 - $55 for each series. DHPP  $20 - $25. DHLPP  $22 - $28. Bordatella (Kennel Cough)  $20 - $25. *Heartworm test  $30 - $40. Fecal test  $20 - $25.

All of our dogs have some potty training under their belly, however, dogs less than 8 - 10 months of age are not considered reliably potty trained.  Most dogs, regardless of whether or not they are reliably potty trained, may have accidents in a new environment until they are taught where to go in order to be let outside to their potty area..

Dogs 7 months and up (over 30 lbs.) spayed/neutered -$100.00. Puppies 6 months and under that are already spayed/neutered -$150.00. Puppies that are NOT yet spayed/neutered - $150.00 (a deposit of $100 will be required. This deposit is refundable upon showing proof that the animal has been spayed/neutered.). Important Note for Dog/Puppy Adoptions:.  We do NOT allow invisible fences.  The dog/puppy is NOT allowed to be tied or chained out for any reason..  The dog/puppy is NOT allowed to run loose for any reason.. Complete and submit the Adoption Application. Filling out the adoption application is not a commitment to adopt; it is simply the first step in the process. For an adoption application, please email info@dontbullymerescuetexas.org or you can simply do it on line through our website.. Step 2: Be interviewed by an Adoption Counselor. Our adoption counselors are well trained and are required to ask for detailed information about the potential living arrangements for our animals.. Step 3: Meet the dogs to find a good match for you and your lifestyle.. Step 4: The Application Review Committee will process your application. Dont BULLY Me Rescue is not able to accept every application for adoption and reserves the right to reject an application. Applications are PROCESSED on a first come first serve basis but are APPROVED based on which application is the best match for the animal.  We do perform a vet check and a reference check.  For the vet we are looking to make sure all animals are current on their vaccinations, rabies, on a monthly heartworm preventative and spayed or neutered. If this passes we will schedule a home visit.  We have set guidelines for application acceptance and realize that your opinion may differ from ours. Thank you for your understanding.. Step 5: If your Adoption Application is approved, you will fill out an Adoption Contract and other important documents. The Contract is a legally-binding document that spells out your responsibilities as the owner of the pet you are adopting. In addition, the Contract provides you with a record of the medical care that our rescue provided for the animal.. Note: Must be at least 20 years old to adopt.  If you are renting we will require speaking with your landlord and getting a written document stating you are allowed to have pit bulls where you are renting.. **Every penny of an adoption fee goes towards the dogs' medical expenses. In fact, in almost all cases, the adoption fee falls far short of the actual medical expenses spent on the dogs.  We rely on public donations we receive. The adoption fees are used to cover the cost of medical treatments incurred while the dog is in the possession of Don't BULLY Me Rescue prior to adoption. We may pull a dog from a shelter that is healthy and we may only have to spend a small amount of money to have that dog ready for adoption. In this case, the profit from that dog's adoption fee is applied to the vetting costs of the many others whose vetting costs are not so fortunate. There are times the adoption fee for a dog that is not healthy starts as low as $100 when it could easily cost Don't BULLY Me Rescue as much as $2,000 or more to vet this dog depending on the medical issues.**.

Adoption Applicant Requirements Include:.    Must be 18 years of age or older.    Must provide a valid driver's license or identification.    Must reside in the home where the animal will be placed.    Application must be filled out by the adopter; no one is allowed to complete the application on behalf of a potential adopter. .    If the applicant rents a home, Landlord information will be required including a statement from the Landlord agreeing to allow pets.. When the adopter has selected the pet they wish to adopt, they will fill out an Adoption Questionnaire.  The questionnaire will provide information about their past experience with pets, the type of pet they are looking for and also their expectations of the new pet. The purpose of the questionnaire is not to exclude them from adopting. It is simply a tool that helps the Center match people with a pet that would best fit their lifestyle and expectations.. Before an adoption can be approved, the following is required:  .    Applicant has spent time to get acquainted with the animal they are interested in.    Applicant has been interviewed by a Paws and Claws volunteer.    All family members and/or roommates must meet the animal.    If there are other animals in the home, an introduction will be needed to assure the animals compatibility  and  documentation that the other animals are current on vaccinations and spayed  or neutered.    A home check may or not be required; each adoption will vary due to the needs of the particular animal.  If a home check is required, a convenient time for all parties will be set.. . FINALIZING THE ADOPTION.    Review the contract with the adopter.  Discuss each item in the contract and ask the adopter to initial each one..    Review Paws and Claws return policy..    Review the animal's medical information..    Scan the animal to assure that the microchip information is correct..    Obtain the Adoption Donation..    Explain Paws and Claws follow-up procedure..    Have the adopter sign and date the adoption agreement.  The Paws and Claws volunteer coordinating the adoption must sign as well..    Give the adopter a copy of the adoption agreement and the animal's medical records.. . FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURE. Adopters do not always call the Center when they experience a problem; therefore, it is important to follow-up after the adoption to assure problems are addressed in a timely manner.  Good follow-up helps lower the return rate and maintains a successful adoption relationship.. Adoption follow-up contacts via telephone or e-mail will be done:.    Three days after the adoption,.    Three weeks after the adoption, and.    Three months after the adoption.. Some important questions to ask include:.    How is the animal settling into the new routine and home?.    Are there any behavioral issues that we can assist with?.    Has the animals name been changed?.    How are the other pets in the home adjusting to the newest member of the family?. All information received from the adopter will be recorded in the animal's file.. . RETURN POLICY. No matter how careful the Center will be in attempting to match the right pet with the right family, there will be occasions where animals are returned to the Center.  Adoption Donations are not refundable. Adoption Donation of $80 for dogs, $50 for cats, $100 for puppies, and $75 for kitties is requested. 	Paws and Claws. 104 Sublet Avenue.

5681	Available	All Breed Rescue, Inc	491 Industrial Avenue	Williston	VT	5495	United States	(802) 489-5889		allbreedvt@allbreedrescuevt.com	http://www.allbreedrescuevt.com/	http://www.facebook.com/allbreedrescuevt	Rescue	dogs	All Vermont, northern NY, NH	All Breed Rescue is a compassionate non-profit rescue organization dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in Vermont and from high-kill shelters in the South. We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.. Step 1   Complete Adoption Application The first step in the adoption process is filling out the application on our website. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, your home environment and your experience with pet ownership. We cannot accommodate an introduction with one of our dogs without this first step being completed.. Step 2   Application Preliminary Review Our application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information. Please allow 24   48 hours for a volunteer to get back to you. After submitting your application, be sure to add allbreedvt@gmail.com to your contacts or check your spam folder. Most of our communication is done via e-mail.. Step 3   Landlord Approval Verified If it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations. If your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.. Step 4   Veterinary References Contacted Our volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you dont have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped. We are happy to make recommendations if you are looking for a veterinarian. If your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be held until you can provide this information.. Step 5   Personal References Contacted Our volunteers will contact your personal references and ask them questions in regards to whether they consider you to be a responsible pet owner. This is the portion of the process that can take the most amount of time. It is helpful if you contact your references and ask them to return our calls in a timely manner. If our reference checking volunteers have any major concerns about adopting a dog to you, based on communication with your references, your application may be denied at this point in the process.. Step 6   Meeting between Approved Applicant & Available Dogs. Most of our dogs are currently boarding at a facility in South Burlington, however our organization is volunteer run. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our dogs until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process. Once you have been approved, a volunteer will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. Just because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. All adoptions are first come, first served and we cannot  hold  a dog based on interest alone. Our priority is placing dogs in loving homes. If you fall in love at the time of your meeting but are not ready to bring the dog home with you, a dog can be reserved for three days with a non-refundable deposit of $150. This deposit will be applied to the total adoption fee when the adoption is finalized.. Step 7   Finalizing The Adoption Once you have decided on the dog a volunteer will proceed with paperwork. This includes reviewing and signing an adoption agreement, vet services form, and transfer of all ownership and vetting that we have on the dog. Adoption fees must be paid by cash, money order, or bank check only. Please note, as we rescue the majority of our dogs from high-kill Southern shelters we do not know a lot about the dogs history, genetics, age, or behaviors. We are able to share information we gather based on what we learn of our dogs during their time with us and in foster homes and based on their wellness exams by veterinarians.. Step 8   Trip to the Vet It is recommended that you make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible after adopting a dog from our program. While every effort is made to provide the best possible care once these dogs come to us, we cannot guarantee their health. Although all of our dogs have had their basic vaccines and are dewormed monthly, some clinical signs of viruses do not show up prior to adoption. Additionally, if, at the time of adoption, your dog was not already spayed/neutered, you would have been required to sign a spay/neuter agreement. Our adoption contract requires all dogs to be spayed/neutered within one month of adoption or when age appropriate. You are asked to notify us when and by who this surgery will be will be performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed/neutered. If you fail to spay/neuter, as outlined in the adoption contract you signed, our organization will take appropriate measures to take back the dog. Step 9   Optional Post Adoption Follow-up Visit Our adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. All Breed Rescue is committed to the life, health and well-being of every dog we place for the remainder of that dogs life. Should the adoption not work out or you need to rehome the dog, we require, by contract, that the dog be returned to us.performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed/neutered.

The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. will not be responsible for any of these fees.. . 3. There is no guarantee that a healthy-appearing pet is not incubating an illness which may become obvious after you take it home. The Parma Animal Shelter suggests that you take your new pet to your Veterinarian. If within 10 days from the date of adoption a serious health problem is discovered, you may make arrangements to return the animal, along with the Veterinarian's documentation of the illness. You may not return the pet due to behavior or minor health problems. The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. reserves the right to refuse the return of any animal.. . 4. To assist the Parma Animal Shelter in acquiring PERMANENT HOMES for its animals and to prevent TRYING OUT an animal, the adoption fee is non-refundable. No monetary refunds will be given under any circumstances. Parma Animal Shelter Inc. makes no warranty with respect to the temperament of the pet and will not be held responsible for any damages should the pet act in an aggressive manner.. . 5. Any animal adopted into a multiple pet household should be confined from the rest of the pets for at least 7-10 days This will allow time for any communicable illnesses to appear and be treated by your veterinarian without spreading to other pets.. . 6. Anyone found in violation of this adoption agreement and who fails to correct the violation within 48 hours, shall forfeit the adopted animal to the Parma Animal Shelter Inc. and be subject to possible fines.. .  . . The form above is used for every adoption.. . The adoption fee is $85 for dogs and cats with reduction in price on dogs and cats over 7 yrs old to $50.00.   Puppies under 6 months are $100.. . DOGS.  . Dogs get: 1 year rabies shot, distemper/parvo shot, Bordetella vaccine,. Heartworm test and 1st heartworm pill,  they are  also checked for worms.. We take them to the Vet of our choice for spay/neuter..  . Adoption Fee for Cats and Kittens   updated 1/30/2013  KITTENS are combo tested and given FVRCP vaccines until 3 months old (3 weeks apart up to a total of 3 shots). A one-year rabies vaccine (and certificate), blacklighting/lyme dip (for ringworm prevention), two Advantage Multi treatments and four Pyrantel dewormings are administered as well. Spay/neuter (through a local Veterinarian) is done when the kitten is three pounds. No kitten can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered.  CATS are the same as kittens with the exception of a total of two FVRCP vaccines.  No cat can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered..  . We do not adopt animals as gifts or surprises.  The entire household where the animal will live must be interviewed and adoption application submitted for consideration by the Warden and the adoption committee.  If more than one adoption application is submitted for any animal, the decision is based on what is believed to be the best home available -- NOT first come, first serve.  Animals must be held for 5 days to give the owners a chance to find them.  During this time we can accept applications for adoption in case the owner doesn't come in.  We cannot hold animals till a decision is made whether to submit an application.  If the animal to be adopted is a dog and there is already a second dog in the household, the adoption counselor will want them to bring their other animals in for an interaction at the shelter so their compatibility can be judged.  There are pamphlets available at the shelter and information on this web site that will inform and advise you in the care of the animal you are adopting.  The volunteers are also available to answer questions you may have prior to and following the adoption.  Our mission is to find loving PERMANENT homes for these animals left homeless through no fault of their own.  The experience of being in a shelter is traumatic and distressing when the animals first come in.  We try very hard to make them comfortable during their stay with us.  Please be sure you research your decision to adopt before you apply.  We do not want to traumatize any of our guests further by causing them to be returned after adoption.

We put a lot of time and effort into rescuing our animals and want to ensure the best permanent home is found for our regal canines. Please consider this prior to completing an application for adoption. If you cannot afford to pay a nominal adoption fee, are you going to be able to afford the care of the dog over his/her lifetime? For further information on why we charge an adoption fee, please visit our adoption donation section.. . We require all applicants complete an adoption application prior to being invited to meet our pets. The reason that we request the application upfront is to ensure your home and family are the right fit for the adoptable pet..  . . 2.      Joe Joes Place requires home visits for all potential adopters. The home visit allows us to verify that the applicant s documented information is accurate. It is also imperative in identifying potential problem areas on the property including gaps in the fence where a dog may escape or items such as small toys, cleaning products, plants, etc. that may cause harm to an animal. The volunteer will also be able to answer any specific questions as related to the adoption and offer his/her personal experience. The home visit may occur at the same time as the adoption provided that the volunteer foster does the adoption. If the home visit is not completed by the volunteer foster, the volunteer foster will be in touch with the potential adopter after the home visit is completed.. . 3.      When meeting our available pets the potential adopter will be invited to one of our adoption events or meet at one of our foster homes. We ask that all family members are present when the meeting takes place and you bring any current dogs living in the home with you for the meeting.. . 4.      After you have completed the application, home visit, and meet the potential dog, you will be presented with an adoption contract, complete with a copy of the dog s vetting records. Our adoption fee is $300.00 and this adoption donation is tax deductible to the adopter. All adoption donations are Non-Refundable.. . 5.      Joe Joes Place requires that all pets adopted through our organization are altered at six months of age. The fee is included in your adoption donation.  If you are adopting a puppy under six months of age, you will need to sign a spay/neuter agreement. Once you have spay/neutered your dog, mail the documentation to the mailing address noted on your contract. We follow up with 100% of all adopters to ensure all of our rescued dogs have been altered.. . 6.      Joe Joes Place also recommends that new adopters have identification tags with your contact information made or have the animal micro chipped as soon as possible. We do not intend on dogs getting lost, but unfortunately no matter how careful you are, it may happen. It is also easier to prove ownership in the event your dog is lost.

Our adoption process begins with an adoption application which will be provided to any interested adult 21 years of age, or older.  We will also require a veterinarian?  reference.. . We are looking for very special people who truly care about these animals, not as property, but who will be accepted as loving, long-term companions being welcomed into the lives of their adoptive families. Our priority is to ensure the cats will never again need to be rescued, will never be hungry and, most importantly, will never be abused. In order to accomplish this goal, we ask all potential adoptive parents to fully fill out and complete a detailed adoption application. . . Adoption from NVEcats means that you will be asked to make a tax deductible adoption donation, pay for spaying/neutering, and any other medical care required before the felines are allowed to enter into the USA.  Foster homes for cats and kittens newly arrived in the US are also available.  The cost for their care and sheltering in a Foster Home will be $300.00 for a single cat, and $450.00 for bonded pairs.  We also request that the Adopter agree to follow-up visits and updates which will be made by a representative from NVEcats.

If the foster family approves of the adoption at the end of your meeting, you'll be allowed to take the dog home with you (yay!), so it's best to come prepared with a leash and collar. If you don't bring your own supplies, you may be able to purchase Copper's Dream supplies for a $20 donation ($10 for the leash and $10 for the collar). . . Step 4. Receive Adoption Paperwork: Within 48 hours of adopting you'll receive their official adoption contract and vaccination/medical history through email. 	Our dogs can be met everyday through our dedicated fosters or at our adoption events most Saturdays.	adoptions	No	Yes

I would like to give you a brief insight of our foster program:. HSS does require a mandatory Preadopt application (attached), a veterinary reference, possible home inspection and introduction to other pets in the household (at the discretion of the foster guardian), then a signed legally binding contract -sealing the adoption of the animal to the new family). HSS is a network of foster homes (not a boarding kennel or rooms with stacked crates...), then there is food (we prefer using a better quality for our animals -no grains/allergies). HSS also does not crowd our foster homes with numerous animals; giving more undivided attention to the care, training and nurturing of each specific animal in that home (we even offer 'guidance gatherings'-our own information booklets from parasites to diseases, etc. to our foster volunteers).. HSS has a mandatory 'hold or quarantine' period of a minimum of two weeks; most symptoms of infection or disease have a 7-10 day incubation period (you never know what they may have been exposed to in the shelters/outdoors). This period also grants us with an insight to each specific animals  needs, temperament and personality, also helping us to adopt them into the appropriate homes HSS, prior to adopting ANY animal is already: spayed/neutered, vaccinated with at least 2 and up to 4 puppy/kitten series of DHPP/FVRCP (even Rabies and Bordetella as well) -including dewormers, allwormers, flea/tick and/or started on HW prevention, combo and/or heartworm tested and microchipped (as well as groomings, etc. as needed. Most of our animals are leash trained and almost, if not, completely house trained prior to placement. Only with an approved preadopt application, will a scheduled meet/greet be arranged. The adoption fees vary per each specific animal in our care. . HSS takes pride in our foster protocol to only adopt out a healthy, happy, well socialized and loving animal(s) allowing a more committed placement of our animals.

We do accept out of state applications as long as you are willing to travel to us to meet the dogs before a final adoption decision is made.. . Welcome to the Kingdom!   . We would like to take a moment to introduce ourselves to you and your organization. After many months of planning and preparation, launched Royalty Dog Rescue, LLC on April 26th, 2013.  We are an all volunteer res- cue groups, located in beautiful Tuscarawas County, Ohio. We began as a small group formed to help save dogs in need, and have grown to over 20 fosters and almost 15 volunteers.  We do not have a facility - our pets for adoption are fostered, providing them with a sense of a home life while they wait for their forever home. We work with other rescues in the area by taking in some dogs when they are filled to capacity. Founded by dog lovers, who combined have over 40 years of rescue experience. We have thoroughly screened foster par- ents for the dogs in our program.       Our mission statement is, Royalty Dog Rescue saves dogs who have run out of time at dog pounds and brings people and animals together to enrich each others lives. Our goals include the rescue, rehabilitation, spay/neuter and adoption of the abandoned dogs, as well public education regarding breeds and the im- portance of spay/neuter of animals in battling the escalating overpopulation problem.    Royalty Dog Rescue, take dogs into our program from dog pounds, humane societies, surrendered by owners and from commercial breeders. We will never pay an individual or breeder for a dog.  All dogs are spayed/neutered and receive complete vet care, before they can be adopted.         In compliance with State of Ohio law, we are a registered rescue, we are an Incorporated Non-profit and we are a registered 501c3 non-profit with the IRS.   We are solely run on donations, whether from adoptions, events or fundraisers.	The first step in adopting from Royalty Dog Rescue is to fill out our adoption application, which can be found on our web site. . . Once we receive that, we will call your personal references and your vet. Please make sure and let your vet know that we will be calling and give them permission to speak to us! Remember, we are a small all volunteer rescue, so it may sometimes take a week or two once we receive your application to call them. Please be patient with us during this process. . . . The second step is that we arrange a meet and greet with the dog or dogs that you are interested in. Our adoption procedure includes having several meet and greet with our prince or princesses, along with their foster parents before an adoption is finalized. If you are willing to commit to these visits, we are more than willing to adopt to you and your family. Adopting a rescue dog is a long term commitment .We are not a facility, all of our dogs are in foster homes. The meet and greet will be held at one of our board members home. If you currently have pets in your home, you are more than welcome to bring them to this meeting.  . . . The third step in the process is that we will arrange for a home visit. We will bring the dog or dogs that you are interested to your home. . . The final step in the process is that the Royalty Dog Rescue Board members will meet and decide which kingdom is the best fit for our Royal and then the adoption will be finalized. We do require that you come to us for your final adoption also. . . Some important things to note:. . It may take a week or two to arrange a meet and greet due to the foster families schedule. . . . Our policy is NOT first come first serve, it is whomever is the best fit for the dog and sometimes the dog chooses for us! ?╟∩. . If a home visit is done more than 60 miles from Dover, Ohio, a $25.00 mileage fee will be added for each 60 miles, to the adoption donation. . . . YES!! We do adopt ?╟∩out of state, but, you are required to come to us for the meet and greets and adoption. In the case of an out of state adoption, we utilize a rescue close to you to preform the home visit. If you are willing to make these trips, then we are willing to adopt out of state! No, we are sorry, we do not ship our animals.  . .  All adopters must sign a contract and agree to return any dog to us if you cannot keep him/her for any reason.. Fee's are decided individually for each dog and are determined by their vet care.	All of our Royal's are able to be seen once an approved application has been processed. We are not a facility, we are foster homes only. Once your application has been approved and a home visit completed, our adoption coordinator arranges an appointment for our Royal's to be seen.

Our animals will be up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered and micro-chipped before an adoption is finalized. Adoption fees vary and depend upon the age and type of animal and any special needs.	We are currently entirely foster-based so all of our animals are in the homes of volunteers while we search for their perfect forever home. If somebody would like to meet one of our adoptable pets, they simple need to contact us to arrange a time and we will make it happen. We also do bi-monthly adoption events in Lakewood, Colorado and would be happy to introduce people to any of our adoptable pets at those events.

When they find an animal that they may be interested in meeting they will then complete an adoption application.  This will then start the process of a potential adoption. It does not bind an applicant to the specified animal that they complete the application for, it merely is a request to meet an available STAR animal.. . Application Review- All Applications are thoroughly reviewed. If the applicant may be the right match for the animal, it will be forwarded to the foster caregiver for review.  If the foster caregiver feels that their foster animal would be a good fit for the potential adopter; he or she will contact the applicant to answer questions about the animal and make arrangements for a meet and greet.. Please understand that it is very important to find the right match for both the animal and the adopter.  An application that is not approved for a certain animal does not necessarily mean that the adopter would not make a great pet guardian; it merely means that the adoption may not have been the right match.. . Approval to go Forward with a Meet and Greet- Meet and greets are scheduled with the foster caregiver and the potential adopter.  These can be done at any convenient location for the foster caregiver.  Adoption events would be the preferred location, but often time they are done at the caregiver s home, the potential adopter s home, or an animal friendly business. . . Home Visit- If after the meet and greet, the animal is determined to be the right match for the adopter, the adoption will then be listed as pending.  A home visit will then be completed by a STAR volunteer.  This is a home visit to determine if the home is a safe place for the animal.  If a dog requires a fenced in yard, this will also be thoroughly checked at this time. . . Finalize Adoption- After the home visit is approved, the adoption can then be finalized.  There will be an adoption contract to fill out and the adoption fee to make payment for.  Arrangements can then be made with the foster caregiver to pick up the new family member!. 	Meet and greets can be set up with the individual fosters.	adoptions, fostering, spay/neuter	No	Yes

We also cover the states of Georgia and Tennessee. 	Adoption Process. We are so excited you are considering adding a furry friend to your family! We can t wait to work with you and find the perfect match!. All our adoptions follow the same process. First, please complete an adoption application. If you already have your eye on a specific baby, you can write their name in on the form, if not, don t worry we will help make the perfect match for you. Please remember that just because you write a dog s name in, that it is not a guarantee that dog will be available. If we have multiple applicants on a dog we will be looking for the best fit for that dog, but don t worry we will help you!. After you complete the adoption application we will email you to let you know it has been received. A volunteer will begin processing the application which consists of: verifying information, completing a vet reference, checking personal references, and lastly a home visit to be approved.. Common Questions:. How long does it take?. Applications take on average 1-2 weeks to complete. Please remember we are all volunteers. A great way to speed this up is to let your references know they will be receiving a call from us, one of the number one reasons applications get slowed down is waiting on return calls from your references. You may also want to let your vet know we are calling as some won t release information without your consent. Also, double check the phone numbers. addresses, and emails you provide.. Why do you ask so many questions?. Dogs coming from our rescue have ended up with us because someone along the way failed them. Our commitment is to the dogs and we want to make sure to get the right match. Maybe you have your heart set on Fluffy, but Fluffy is terrified of elevators and you live on the 12th floor of a condo building. Fluffy might not be the right dog for you, but with all the information we have we can show you some other matches that might be just what you are looking for!. What happens if the dog I want is adopted?. Don t worry! The right match is out there for you and we will help you consider other possibilities that meet your needs.. Why should I apply if I don t see the right dog yet?. If you are looking to adopt a highly desirable dog we suggest getting pre-approved. Dogs that are young (under 3, and especially puppies), female, very small (under 15 lbs), etc usually have a lot of interest. If the dog you are looking for fits any of those characteristics, we recommend getting on the approved list now. When the dog you are looking for pops up you can let us know immediately to be first in line.. . . . 	We so not have a shelter facility in Florida. Our dogs are cared for in foster homes located across the state. 	Adoptions	No	Yes

Flight. costs, travel cages, pre-flight veterinary exams and export paperwork can run anywhere from. $300 to $1000 depending on a number of variables (which airline, the absence or presence of a. flight volunteer, the size of the dog, the size of the travel cage, whether any boarding is. required during transit).. We feel it is important to outline these costs here, since although the low end is comparable to. many animal shelter and rescue adoption fees, the high end can potentially be prohibitive for. some adopters. We also feel it is imperative to point out that the remainder of the transit cost,. left over after what is paid for by you, must be funded by ISDF.. Although some of our adoptable dogs have flights that have been paid for partially or even fully. by ISDF fundraising efforts, there are always other costs involved with transport: extra. paperwork, pet taxis, boarding at layover sites, cargo fees and taxes when we pick up the dogs. at the airport - as well as fostering, feeding, and veterinary care costs spent prior to flying and. after flying, but before adoption.. Additionally, most of our dogs are not funded in full, despite our best efforts, so we must. constantly borrow against helping future dogs for fees outside what we fundraised. With this in. mind, please understand that we suggest a minimum donation of $300, if at all possible (again,. to reiterate, we would never want adoption costs to drive away potential adopters, so please. know this is a guideline for giving only) so that we may continue to help the maximum number. of seriously needy dogs.. With no paid staff and no overhead costs, 100% of all donations from adoption fees and our. fundraising efforts goes towards helping not only the dog you adopt, but all others going. forward in future. The more ISDF must pay out per dog, the less we are able to help. the many others awaiting homes of their own.. We are happy to go over your particular dog's estimated costs in greater detail during the home. visit, should you have more questions - but at this time, we would like an idea of what you. think you would be able to cover. This also helps us guide you when advising you about the. many dogs available for adoption.	Every 2nd Saturday of every month ISDF has an adoption event at:. . Petsmart .

Once an animal is placed from our rescue, the animal cannot be sold, given away or otherwise transferred. If the adopter is, at any time, unable to keep or continue to maintain the animal for any reason, the animal must be returned to the St. Mary s Animal Welfare League. . . We work hard at matching our animals to adopters, so they may end their search for a loving, permanent home. Temperament, special needs and personality are all factors in our placements. . Step #1 . The Adoption Application . The initial step in our adoption process is the Adoption Application. This can either be done online or in person. The Adoption form must be filled out completely including vet references and two personal non-family references. Your application will be reviewed and your references will be contacted. We contact your veterinarian to ensure that your current or recently deceased pets were properly taken care of---this means being current on all vaccinations and spayed or neutered. In order to speed up the process, please contact your veterinarian and let them know to expect our call. . Step #2. Personal Interview You will be interviewed by a SMAWL Board Member or Volunteer either through phone, email or in person. This is an opportunity to learn more specifics about you, your family, your pets and the type of pet you are looking for. At this time, we may suggest that you consider a different animal---one that we may feel might be more acceptable for your situation. If you are completing your application in person, this will most likely be done at that time of completion.. Step #3. The Home Visit If all goes well with the application verification, we will schedule a home visit. A home visit is required to ensure that your home is everything you say it is on the Adoption Application. It needs to be a suitable safe environment for your new pet. All pets and family members should be home at this time.. Step #4. Meeting Your Potential Adoptee Once the Application has been reviewed and all references checked, arrangements will be made for you to meet with the animal you wish to adopt, either through the foster parent or the animal s Case Manager. As a courtesy to our foster families, we do not ask them to show their animals to individuals until we have completed the application approval process. If you have other animals, we recommend a neutral meeting place, such as PETCO or a local park to ensure the animals are compatible outside of their own territory.. Step #5. Finalizing The Adoption Once the adoption has been approved, we will contact you to finalize the adoption. You will need to sign the contract and pay our adoption fee. (Dogs=$200, Young Cats 2 years and under =$125, Older Cats over 2 years = $75) . Foster to adopt over a two week period may be available on a case by case basis.. Any applications received for adoptions from beyond St Mary's county line, will be subject to additional terms and conditions available on request.. Please Remember: Our entire organization is staffed by volunteers. We have NO paid staff. Our volunteers must work your application around their business and personal lives. It may take as long as one week for you to hear from someone, but typically most applications are approved within 7-10 days. Please be patient and thank the volunteers you meet for their service to our community s homeless pet population.	Come meet our pets every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. located at Petco in California Maryland.. We also have our cat shelter in Callaway.

Due to the specific needs of the German Shepherd breed, our application process to become an approved adopter with us has several steps. It typically takes about two weeks to complete the process and see if you are approved to adopt from us.. . We realize our process seems like a lot to go through to adopt but we want to ensure when an adoption is made it is the best home possible for the dog and that the adopter is equally as happy. Most importantly we want the adoption to be successful and permanent!. . . . 1.       Complete our online application. There is a $10.00 non-refundable application fee that will go toward administrative costs. Please note that an application does not lock you into adopting the dog you apply for. We do our best to accommodate you, however, because of timing; there may be another applicant ahead of you that is an appropriate match for the same dog.. . 2.       Reference Checks. We DO call your references AND your Vet (if you have one). Please be sure to advise your vet and your references we will be calling. The biggest delay in processing your application is often veterinary offices or personal references NOT calling us back promptly.. . 3.       Phone Interview. Shortly after you submit your application, one of our volunteers will call you to review your application and ask a few more questions.. . 4.       Home Visit. Once all the references are completed, we will conduct a home visit. This is so we can know get to know you better and the environment the dog will be living in. We require ALL members of the household who will be interacting with the dog to be present when we visit.. . 5.       Matching you with the right dog. Even during the process, we keep in mind all our available dogs and any preferences you indicated on your application. While you can tell us which one you would like to meet, we will let you know about all the dogs that we think would flourish in your home.. . Meet and Greets. This is when you meet the dog or dogs. It may be at the foster home, your home or another location that is convenient for everyone. If there is a dog already in the home we typically require two meetings. First one outside of your home and the second at your home.. . You will sign our adoption contract, make your tax deductible donation and you can bring your new family member home!. . Why is your process so rigorous?. . When we accept a German Shepherd into our rescue, we make a commitment to him or her, to care for them, get them healthy again and find them a permanent, loving home. We want to make sure that our applicants understand the lifetime commitment they are making and that they can provide our dogs a great new life.. . Adoption Requirements. . The adopter must be between the ages of 21 and 76 years of age.. . If you rent, you must ensure that your landlord allows large breed dogs to live in the apartment or home and show proof of the consent.. . We require our adopters to attend professional obedience training with their adopted dog.. . All animals currently living in the home must be up-to-date on vaccinations unless there is a medical reason. . Our adoption fees are as follows:. $350 for puppies up to 1 year of age. $275 for a dog from 1 to 7 years of age. $150 for a dog 7 years or older. . We will require a $150 refundable spay/neuter deposit for any unaltered dog that is adopted out. Proof of the procedure is required for a deposit refund.	Only potential adopters can meet our dogs. After they have gone through the adoption process and are approved we set up a meet and greet with the dog. Then if it goes well, a second meet and greet is scheduled at the home of the adopter. If they have other dogs, we want to be sure the dogs get along with the GSRNJ dog. 	Adoptions, foster, education	No	Yes

Please read all items carefully. If you are interested in adopting any of our dogs, please fill out the form at the bottom of every page. Thank you!. . Designer Dog Rescue s goal is to place homeless dogs into loving homes and families. We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. Our adoption process may seem time consuming or unnecessarily complicated, but please understand that we have our dogs  best interests at heart. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.. . Please understand that our organization is completely run by unpaid volunteers, who dedicate their free time to help the dogs.  We thank you for your time and patience throughout our adoption process.. Step 1   Fill out a Adoption Application. . The first step is to have you fill out a adoption application. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, training beliefs and background with animals.. Step 2   Application Preliminary Review. . Our application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information.. Step 3   Landlord Approval Verified. . If it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations.. . If your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.. Step 4   Veterinary References Contacted. . Our volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped.. Step 5   Home Visit and Applicant Interview. . Our organization requires home visits to determine that the dog will be living in a safe environment. This is an informal chance for us to get to. know you, your lifestyle, home environment and determine which dog(s) in our program might be the best fit. The home visit volunteer will do a short walk-through of your home and yard to ensure its safety and to advise on any areas of concern. All household members must be present for the home visit.. . If our home visit volunteers have any major concerns about your home environment, or if you refuse a home visit, your application will be denied at this point in the process.. . Distance is a factor in whether or not the required home visit can be completed. We are a 100% volunteer run organization. Although we do have volunteer contacts in many areas, some areas may be difficult for us to locate a volunteer to conduct the home visit. We will let you know ASAP if your application needs to be denied due to our inability to find a volunteer to conduct the home visit. You can also contact a rescue close to your area to do a home check.. . We do not Adopt out of California!. Step 6   Meeting between Approved Applicant & Available Dogs. . Our organization does not have a shelter where the dogs can be visited. Our dogs are in foster homes. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our fosters until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process.. . Once you have been approved, a volunteer (usually the foster) will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. This meeting may occur at the foster s residence or your home.. . Just because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. For some dogs we receive many applications so we may allow multiple applicants to have a meeting with the dog before we choose the home that we feel will be the best fit for the dog. Also, if the volunteer involved in the meeting with you and the dog, does not feel you are a good fit for the dog, you may be denied adoption of that particular dog but you may be allowed to adopt another dog.. Step 7   Adoption Trial Period. . If you have decided upon a dog that you would like to adopt, the adoption trial period (two weeks) can begin. At the start of the trial you are required to sign an adoption contract and to provide payment of the adoption donation fee. Checks received will not be cashed until the adoption has been made official.. . If needed, our organization can provide a kennel/crate, food/water bowls, leash and collar for you to use during the trial period. We may also provide a small supply of dog food that will allow you to transition the dogs diet to another food.. . If at any time during the trial period you are having issues with the dog, email or call and inform us. A volunteer will be in touch with you asap.. Step 8   Adoption Official. . If, at the end of the two week trial, our organization has NOT heard from you, our organization will consider the adoption official. Your adoption donation fee will be deposited and will no longer be refundable. We will also mail out to you all veterinary paperwork we have for the dog..

Approval to have the type of pet you are interested in adopting from landlord or rental agencies if you rent or lease your home, condo or apartment. A letter of reference from your veterinarian. Since some of our pets have had serious medical conditions, we want to ensure that you have a commitment to provide the ongoing care they may need.. Please understand that we deal with homeless or unwanted animals. Many of our animals come from unknown backgrounds through local shelters. Most have medical or behavioral concerns that we have addressed as well as providing their well care. The adoption process may seem time consuming, but we wish to maximize an animal s chance for a successful, permanent adoption. Adopting a companion pet is a major consideration and responsible pet ownership demands a considerable commitment. All we ask in return is that you love and care for this pet for its lifetime and make a donation that will allow us to help the next friend in need.. .  . . ADOPTIONS INCLUDE:. . Any medical condition that they arrived with is treated completely (ie: orthopedic surgery, demodex, cystotomy, parvo, upper respiratory infection, etc.) which often requires weeks to months of medications and nursing care.. For those who will need ongoing or lifetime treatment adopter s will receive at least 1-6 months  worth of medications.. A general health exam and blood work.. Spay/Neuter surgery.. Heart worm test, and subsequent treatment or preventative.. Felines receive FeLV (Feline Leukemia) and FIV (Feline Aids) tests.. Fecal test and subsequent treatment/preventative..

Adoption Process. . Grey Face Rescue'?╟ s goal is to place our foster dogs into loving homes and families. We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. Our adoption process may seem time consuming or unnecessarily complicated, but please understand that we have our dogs'?╟  best interests at heart. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.. Please understand that our organization is completely run by unpaid volunteers, who dedicate their free time to help the dogs. The entire adoption process takes time; we are unwilling to sacrifice being thorough when the dog s future is at stake. We thank you for your time and patience throughout our adoption process.. Fill out Adoption Application. The first step is to have you fill out a adoption application. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, training beliefs and background with animals.. . Application Review. Our application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information.. . Verifications. If it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations.. If your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.. If you are adopting a bully-breed we will contact your insurance to assure they do not have breed restrictions within their policy.. . Veterinary Reference Contacted. Our volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped.. If your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be stopped until you can provide this information.. Applicant Interview. A volunteer from Grey Face Rescue will contact you via phone to get to know you better along with ask any questions they may have.. Meet & Greet. Our organization does not have a shelter where the dogs can be visited. Our dogs are in foster homes. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our fosters until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process.. Once you have been approved, a volunteer (usually the foster) will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. This meeting may occur at the foster s residence or your home.. Just because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. For some dogs we receive many applications so we may allow multiple applicants to have a meeting with the dog before we choose the home that we feel will be the best fit for the dog. Also, if the volunteer involved in the meeting with you and the dog, does not feel you are a good fit for the dog, you may be denied adoption of that particular dog but you may be allowed to adopt another dog.. Adoption. If you have decided upon a dog that you would like to adopt you are required to sign an adoption contract and to provide payment of the adoption donation fee and spay/neuter deposit if necessary.  At that time you become the owner of the dog.. We will then provide a couple cups of the dog food they have currently been eating, Grey Face Adoption tag, all medical and vet documents, a copy of the contract, transition packet to help in the transition process, a letter from the dogs foster giving you a more in depth info on the dogs likes, dislikes, behaviors, etc. Also, fosters may include specific toys or blankets the dog has become fond of.. We have a two week refund period meaning if you decide the dog is not a good fit for your family and you return him/her within the two week refund period we will return your adoption donation to you. The adoption fee will be deposited upon receipt and refunded only if the adopted dog is returned within the two week refund period (or any prior agreed upon extension of the refund period).. If at any time you are having issues with the dog, please email or call your contact person and inform us. A volunteer will be in touch with you asap.. Optional Post Adoption Follow-Up Visit. Our adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. Grey Face Rescue is committed to the life, health and well being of every dog we place for the remainder of that dog s life. Should the adoption not work out or you need to rehome the dog, we require, by contract that the dog be returned to us. Please notify your rep ASAP.  . 	We will set up appointments with foster and potential adopter.	Adoptions, Foster & Hospice	No	Yes

It must be a suitable home for the pet and the family must meet the needs of that animal before adoption.  We do require a signed contract that spells out what we expect of them.  Pet must be a family member, loved, proper routine care, proper medical treatment when needed, licensing, if pet needs to be surrendered they agree to return it to us.  Our adoption fees are Puppies less than one year old - $400, Dogs between 1 and 5 - $350, and Dogs over the age of 6 - $300. This helps to offset our intake costs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and given a full series of shots by our vets.	When and where can people visit your adoptable pets? *   We attend community events where we bring our fosters to meet the public. Each adoption only happens after the prospective family is chosen by the animal.  Our dream is to have a sanctuary where the public can come and not only tour our facility but meet their furever family member.	We are a 100% volunteer foster based rescue. 	No	Yes

After a potential adopter sees your foster dog s bio on the website or other medium, and is interested in meeting the foster dog, the potential adopter is required to submit a completed dog adoption application. This application is available on our website www.LGARinc.org/Adopt. Once the application is completed, the potential adopter will submit the application online.  LGAR volunteers monitor the incoming applications daily. Every foster dog available for adoption is reviewed by either Jody or Caren and the Adoption Coordinator. . Once a qualified applicant is identified, all references checked and the potential adopter is approved, the Adoption Coordinator will contact the foster parent and ask them to schedule a meet and greet with the applicant. Once you have scheduled a meet and greet, please let the Adoption Coordinator know the date and time of the meeting.. The rescue also requires that all family members of the potential adopter (including family dogs) must be present for the meet and greet, or final adoption. If your foster dog is meeting a resident dog, these meet and greets should take place at a neutral location (not the foster or potential adopter home) unless otherwise directed. The rescue requires a home visit to ensure the safety and compatibility of the foster dog to a new home. The Adoption Coordinator, in conjunction with the foster parent and the potential adopter, schedules these home visits. For example: to ensure a foster dog s compatibility with a resident cat, or other animals.  The volunteer who conducts the home visit must fill out the Home Visit Form and submit it to LGAR upon completion.. After the meet and greet (and if the applicant is still interested in the dog), foster parents should make a recommendation to the rescue regarding the adoption immediately following.. The foster dog always stays with the foster parent until they hear from the rescue. Please remember that all adoptions must be approved by the rescue. Final approval of all adoptions is at the sole discretion of LGAR. Please do not make any promises during a meet and greet. You should always let the potential adopter know that the rescue makes the final decision.. Once the adoption is approved by the rescue, the adopter pays the adoption fee and, if the dog is not already altered, makes a spay/neuter appointment, if necessary. Foster dogs cannot go to a potential adopter s home until the adoption is finalized by the rescue. Many times, the foster dog will stay with the foster parent until the spay/neuter surgery date. In some situations, the rescue may agree to a  spay/neuter deposit , and allow the dog to go with the adopter and the new adopter will provide proof of the surgery to the rescue in return for their deposit. This is at the discretion of the rescue. . . Tax-deductible adoption fees are as follows:. Puppies (dogs under 1 year)  $400. Dogs over 1 year and under 25 lbs   $300. Dogs over 1 year and over 25lbs  $250. Dogs over 7 years (Senior)  $150. 	We are a virtual rescue and our dogs will be located in foster homes in the following states:  CT, NY, NJ, PA, MD, FL.  We will provide transport for approved adopters as needed.. . Our dogs will be visible to the public via our website, our social media pages and hopefully through the rescuegroups.org's pet adoption portal.	Foster, Adoptions	No	Yes

We look at your application and make sure that you are allowed a pet in your home, so that our rescues do not find themselves being surrendered and moved again someday. Once the application is approved, we come to your home and make sure that the home is safe for our rescue pet and that everyone in the home gets along well with them, including other pets. . Our pets live in foster homes and not in a shelter environment. In their homes, they are treated like the families' pets and they work on basic skills and house training. If you would like to meet one of our pets, we can schedule it with the foster family and meet wherever you feel comfortable.. During the adoption, an adoption contract is signed. The contract states that the adopter will not surrender or sell the pet to anyone and will return the pet to the rescue to find him/her a new home, should they not be able to care for them anymore. Among other things, the contract also has the adopter sign stating they will provide the pet with quality food, clean water and regular veterinary care. 	Most of our pets are being fostered in the Des Moines area. All of our fosters have agreed to allow people to come to their homes, by appointment, to visit with the available pets. We do meetings at parks, or pet food stores, and even at the adopters' homes, quite often. .

The application should be emailed to fortheloveofbirdsnj@gmail.com. Be sure to include two personal references and a veterinary reference. We check the references and then will reach out to you to schedule a mutually convenient time to talk on the phone. After your application is approved and based on your preferences, lifestyle and bird experience we will recommend a bird(s) for you to meet. Or you can let us know if you are interested in adopting one of our available birds..  . For small birds like finches and budgies, they typically can be adopted after one visit to their foster home. Medium to large parrots require at least three visits with the bird at their foster home. The reason for this is three fold. This provides the potential adopter with time to consider whether the bird is a good match with their family and life style and gives you time to get your house ready for the bird to move in. Second it gives the bird several opportunities to meet with you and get used to you. Many birds are hesitant with new people during their first visit meeting with them. And finally, it allows the foster home to watch how you interact with the bird and they can pass along information on the bird and educate the potential adopter on bird husbandry as needed. All of our adoptable birds are cared for in private foster homes throughout New Jersey. Each of our birds are treated as the unique individual that they are..  . Please note that we require a waiting period of at least 6 months between bringing new birds into your home. Each bird requires a transition period to be comfortable with their new family and in their new home. Please don't short change your bird by bringing another flock member in too soon..  . There is an adoption fee; fees are listed on our website. Our birds are sent home with their cage, toys and some food to get you started. Additionally, all of our birds are disease tested for Polyoma, Psitticosis and PBFD, and we will give you a copy of the test results..  . For The Love of Birds holds a permit for the care and sale of exotic animals from the State of New Jersey, Division of Fish and Wildlife. All exotic birds that are not exempt in New Jersey must have a hobby permit filed with the state. We will issue you a 20 day temporary permit at the time of adoption. We must file a copy of this temporary hobby permit each year with the Division of Fish and Wildlife. You will need to file for a hobby permit during the first 20 days you have the bird. Exempt birds are budgies, cockatiels, canaries, zebra finches, rock pigeons and society finches. There are a few other exempt birds that we do not take in and offer for adoption. Additionally, all other exotic birds are required to have a band or microchip and have a hobby permit from the State of New Jersey, Division of Fish and Wildlife. YOU DO NOT NEED A SEPARATE PERMIT FOR EACH ANIMAL IN YOUR POSSESSION. If you already have a valid Individual Hobby Permit, you can add additional animals for a fee of $2.00 by writing to the Division of Fish and Wildlife or you can wait until the end of the year and list additions on your renewal form which will be sent to you..  	We are foster home based. We schedule visits with potential adopters with the bird at its foster home. 	adoption, education	No	Yes

This will be a brief but thorough visit to your home and/or yard and performed either by two JustCare volunteers or Ashley and Sabine. . . Step three   Meet & Greet. .   Once it has been determined that a potential adopter's home is the right fit for any given animal, arrangements will be made for the potential adopter and their families to meet the animal. If this is a cat, this will occur on site at JustCare Animal Rescue in Oakville WA by appointment. If this is a dog, this will occur either at the foster s home or at a neutral area such as a park (especially required when meeting potential adopters dog/s.). . Step four   Trial. .

Generally for dogs this will be a 2 week trial and for cats ~6 weeks. If the adopter decides that this pairing will not work out within the trial period, a full refund of the adoption fee will be issued and the animal will come back into the rescue or foster home.

All adoption appointments are scheduled after your application has been approved. Appointments are generally held on Saturdays. We need ALL family members or those living within your home, including pets (dogs not cats), to be present for an appointment. Preference is given to those with a verifiable veterinary reference, home ownership & fenced yard. Home ownership is verified through court records. If you are a renter, you must provide landlord contact information. Understand that the Adoption Application must be processed and approved. Please be patient, we are 100% volunteers but WILL get back to you. Expect an email from DollysLegacy@aol.com in response to your application. PLEASE be sure to answer all questions completely or you will get an error message and have to start over, you MUST complete ALL fields of the application. We do not hold pets for a specific date. If you are going on vacation, or cannot take when the pet is available, please wait to apply until you are ready to adopt. We do out of state/area adoptions, but approved adopters are required to come to an adoption appointment, we do not ship pets. The final approval to adopt is after we have met applicants and feel they are the right match for that particular pet.	All of our adoptable pets with their photos, descriptions, adoption fees & most information requested about them can be seen on our website which is updated daily at this link: http://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/  If they are still listed on our website, they have not yet been adopted.

Adoption Requirements. . Once a Pyrenees has been released by it's former owner, rescued from a shelter, or been found as a stray, PYRescue accepts all responsibility for their medical care, feeding, grooming, training, and ultimate placement in a new home.. . All prospective new guardians complete an adoption application and enter into a legally binding contract that specifies the care required for a Pyrenees and provides for reclamation of the Pyrenees by PYRescue if PYRescue ever has reason to feel that the care of the Pyrenees does not meet the PYRescue standard.. . Under no circumstances is an intact Pyrenees ever released to a new Guardian. All adoptions are followed up on a periodic basis to assure that PYRescue standards are met.. . All potential new guardians must meet with PYRescue personnel and the Pyrenees considered for adoption. Wherever possible the adoptive Pyrenees and other family dogs are also introduced in neutral territory. In the final analysis, the adoptive Pyrenees must be willing to go with the prospective new guardian. If the Pyrenees hesitates or refuses to go the whole adoption is off (we have had several instances of this and if the Pyr does not want to go we find another acceptable home for that Pyr). In general, many of the rescued Pyrenees have been family pets before coming to PYRescue for adoption. If at all possible, they are placed in a pet-oriented family home. However, the ever growing need to find homes has caused PYRescue to place Pyrs also in ranch/farm oriented environments, especially as related to small llama and sheep herds. This approach appears to be working well in situations where the new owners are prepared to be both patient and compassionate towards the Pyr in relation to his/her new environment.. . PYRescue also develops and publishes various educational documents related to the guardianship and care of the Great Pyrenees.	Michael Heffron and Judith Dole. 11603 Bradshaw Road.

But we will NOT finalize an adoption before 7 days is up. We also encourage families to take longer if necessary and will also get a trainer in to work on any potential issues that may be prohibiting the adoption.	We have multiple adoption events every month and post when and where those will be on our Facebook page. We don't ever bring all our dogs to one event, so if there is a specific dog you are interested in meeting at a specific event, please send us a message, email, or give us a call and let us know.
